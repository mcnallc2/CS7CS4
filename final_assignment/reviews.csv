"One of the best game stories I have ever played. Not to mention the improvised multiplayer mode that is very popular.  This game is Rockstar's first complete game in the GTA series. It contains the most options you can take about your character (CJ) so far. You can eat, you can draw tattoos on your body, you can train at a gym, you can drive and tune cars, swim and A LOT more. This is the reason why GTA IV never surpassed GTA:SA. #update for badge ",1,0

"I played this game single-player, so if you are looking for a review of the co-op experience, I won't be able to discuss it here. Very solid experience, and had me glued to my seat! The many collectibles, challenge tombs, as well as rewards for earning higher scores and speed, really had me hooked. In a typical Lara Croft game, you're trying to stop bad guys and get an artifact. This game however is one of the few isometric viewpoint Tomb Raider games, and so the gameplay mechanics aren't what the typical games are like. The gameplay consists of two main components - environment traversal and combat. Environment traversal involves getting creative with various tools, such as a magical spear that can create platforms for Lara to climb to previously unreachable places. There are also explosives which can help with solving environmental puzzles, as well as challenge tombs (many of which need the player to get creative with platforming). Combat is twin-stick shooter style. Lara starts with basic weapons such as her trusty pistols, but eventually unlocks ridiculous stuff like chain gun and rocket launcher. Really makes the second half of a game even more of a blast! I really enjoyed the cadence between puzzles and combat - the two phases alternate between each other, e.g. before getting an important artifact, cue large amount of enemies. However, it's not guaranteed that they are mutually exclusive! Many of the collectibles involve precision platforming, while hordes of enemies are on you. Super fun! Overall I found this a very fun isometric, twin-stick shooter game, with good environmental puzzles and collectible design. Unlocking weapons and solving increasingly difficult challenge tombs and bigger and stronger enemy types (there's also a T-Rex in this game), kept me hooked! This game has been out for quite some time already, but there are still lots of people playing and active on the forums. So if you're looking for a fun single-player, local multiplayer co-op, or even online (might have to try harder to coordinate), this is a great game if you get it on sale! ",1,0

Doesn't take long to get all the achievements plus it doesn't get boring running it multiple times, you basically end up trying to speed run it.

"Ash of Gods: Redemption. This is a fantastic game with a very cool storyline, great atmosphere, gorgeous soundtrack and beautiful art. I have not received such a shake from the combination of the plot and the accompanying music since the days of The Witcher. There are many choices and their consequences. You really empathize with all the heroes. Each one is painstakingly leading along his plot, checking each subsequent step, in the hope of getting a good ending (he did not spoil the walkthroughs). By the way, heroes can be lost here. They are quite mortal ... They can be executed, mutilated, or they can simply die of wounds. In general, not a game, but just fantastic!

"For my taste - very beautiful, bright, amazingly playing with perspective. The solution to the puzzle, its mechanics are always the same, but the conditions of the problem are very variable. And no one will explain exactly how to guess the next one. It will start simple, end very difficult. Everything is concentrated on the perception of the created world. Look for clues (clues to the solution) - in lighting, color, movement, sounds, symbols. A slight feeling that the player is a program that needs to be trained to solve a more complex problem. I've been playing myst for too long to be able to draw some kind of analogy with it, but the feeling from the process is remotely similar. Please do not play according to the guides, everything is possible, everything is decided, you just need to peer or listen. And also, the community contains many illustrations that will make you smile or shake your head understandingly when looking at them. And I will probably keep the scribbled notebook in the box that went through the whole game with me =) I will definitely return to witness, because I have not yet figured out the whole island. ",1,0

"This is definitely the game I and all other former COD4 Promod players have been waiting for for years. The bad reviews made me think a bit before buying the game. - In my opinion, however, these are thoroughly unfounded. The negative reviews consist mainly of complaints about the gameplay, such as ""jumping around the corner"" or ""jumpshots"" and minor gripes like the ""XP bug"". Regarding the XP bug, I would like to say that this is only due to visual reasons, and you still get the XP well written. - When the game is restarted, the updated level is also displayed. I can absolutely relate to the complaints from the gameplay. Just do some research before you buy a game. - There is talk on numerous websites and in Youtube reviews about how essential penalty jumping is. - This fastpaced movement in particular is one of the main factors that makes the game so much fun. The weapons are in! Unranked / bomb mode! Balanced since the latest changes to the heavy weapons and the gameplay is already running incredibly smoothly. Bugs that occurred immediately upon release, such as the midgame fatal error that led to a game crash, were fixed in a first patch. In my opinion, the game is already at a level where you can easily have hours of fun without early access bugs. It should be noted, however, that the player base mainly consists of CoD4 veterans, who sweep you off the map for the first twenty hours and maybe even longer, similar to Aimbot. - But once you have the most important spots on the maps and the movement out, you can keep up! Would give the game 10/10 points despite early access and can understand the negative reviews zero. ",1,1

"Insurgency is a really highly realistic fps game running on a source engine. This sentence will tell you a lot about the game. The game is a pvp realistic shooter, no madness. As I mentioned, the game runs on a source engine and this is a guarantee of great optimization and integration of stea. The game was launched in the form of a mod for Half-Life 2 in 2007 and already at that time garnered a really large number of positive reactions. The game looks really great in terms of graphics. The environment of the maps is really excellently developed, so Insurgency will bring you real enjoyment of the game and a great atmosphere. I can't complain about the sounds, in Insurgency the sounds are elaborate and it sounds really good, but don't wait for the soundtrack in the game. In terms of gameplay, I would compare Insurgency to Red Orchestra 2. The game contains several game modes and there is still something to discover. When buying this game you will definitely not regret your € 10 and if you like fps, you will just be glad that you just bought Insurgency! Definitely try the game! ",1,0

"Neon Beats is a rhythm-based platformer that can remind us of many exponents of the genre such as The Impossible Game or Geometry Dash in the ""cube jumping spike"" style, but with a personal touch and unique game mechanics. First of all, the game is completely free so there is no reason not to try it. The title offers us a tutorial to learn the basics of the controls and three complete levels, which you can easily complete in about 20 minutes. Although I have completed the game with keyboard, to say that it is fully compatible with controllers, and that the experience can be even more comfortable, since in this game, our ""cube jumping spikes"" does not move automatically with the camera: we have full control on it, being able to even go back and make jumps to the walls, being able to bounce from one to another. In addition, death does not imply restarting the entire level from the beginning, it will only take us to the beginning of the section in which we were. This can be of great help for those people who get easily frustrated with this type of game, since it will not cost you to complete it. For those looking for a greater challenge, his is to get all the achievements, in which we will have to complete the levels below a certain time, with the three collectibles and without dying a single time. Despite being only three levels, we find a great variety of situations: platforms with surfaces that appear and disappear or move to the rhythm of the music, jump spikes at full speed, bounce against the walls, use ropes to swing and reach further afield, etcetera. Some collectibles are very well hidden and everything is accompanied by a great soundtrack that increases or decreases the intensity according to the situation in which we find ourselves. Neon Beats is a game with enormous potential, and its creators (who have created it for a University project) have already promised that, starting in September, they will continue to support the game with more levels that will include new mechanics. of game. If they maintain this support and, in turn, continue to receive such positive reviews from the public, I think we are witnessing only a small part of what the title could become in the future. In short, it is totally advisable to try it. For my part, I will closely follow the news about this title and I am already looking forward to the new levels. ",1,0

"I played this game with the sole intention to make a review of it.  I have not played the first game (stand alone ""State of Anarchy"") and I also did not get to the dual wield DLC. Still I got a lot out of this game. NewRelease Games has a portfolio of games among which ""Shadows 2: Perfidia"" and ""Project Starship"", both drawing some attention and with very positive percentage of reviews. The developer seems to have been working on improving the first version of the game, and I am told that this version is smoother and has those extra set of, well, extra, which one looks for in a follow up game.  One of the things one notices as the very beginning of this game is the sound effects (of which most are vocal recordings, and therefore, hilarious). Shooting, rage, and other things in the game set environment have a very sweet and well-coordinated effects. This makes gameplay a lot funnier and makes a game which is simple in its concept pretty awesome. Regarding the soundtrack of the game, it works very much according to the development of the storyline, and the tracks which are played here and there match the game very well, and were probably carefully chosen by the developers and/or de release company. Additionally, the tracks change as the scenery in the back does, which gives it an additional feel. Well played.  Doodle games are not really an acquired taste, but something you can fall in love with from the very start, or despise and shut off after only a couple of minutes. I think most people will fit or be inclined to the first option; doodles are awesome. For us older gamers, ever since we had flash games 10 or 15 years ago and ninja'd through the levels they have been preferred and rarely wouldn't draw our full attention. Perhaps they were more difficult to keep playing, as one couldn't save flash games back then, but we did spend some time on them most definitely. What is also sweet is that these sorts of games are definitely set out for funny kicks, and this game has plenty, which I think is a very positive feat for the genre. You can't take doodles to seriously. Still, you can get along with the storyline and once you get into upgrades, you can grind away on the map, shooting little drawn men shooting red bullets and collecting their moneys and leveling up.  One can get a series of upgrades between different costs or levels. I do think it would have been nice to keep the descriptions of the upgrades appearing which did not happen for me after a few times. Also you get your weapons changed and this is a cool feat, makes you expect something new on every level-boss you beat.  Graphic-wise, it works smoothly, did not run into any bugs or game halts, it did make my graphic card work a bit, which was definitely unexpected, but so much things go on as the you progress through the levels that obviously, to keep everything smooth, you need to get a bit more out of acceleration.  The game logic reminded me a bit of similar games, and the possibility to get into a car is very reminding of the first Grand Theft Auto games 1 and 2, although the story and goals are basically different. The games set-out and the character are both very relatable.  The easy part is that once you get a hang of how to move around in the world it is ""easy"" but as levels progress it get pretty hectic and crazy. I did browse the game, made it to some of the levels, but was probably around 25% finished when I stopped playing. One does require a bit of practice for moving and bullet avoiding, and of course, it only gets more difficult between levels, and from the game angle it is possible to keep avoiding bullets for some time before you will inevitably die. I think that the game angle is definitely a positive part of the game, it lets you notice things which go on around you and lets you immerse more into the game.  A must-get if you like the genre. It delivers good gameplay and it does not get boring, at least for the time I played. Also, it does get an extra credit from me because it still works without internet, and this feat is starting to get ever rarer, especially for fun and entertaining games. There are some which really don't work without internet or they get weird or non-entertaining, and that does not happen to this one. ",1,0

"""Pixel platformer with a good soundtrack"" - this is how my review should start and it actually starts like that, because it's the truth! The big plus of this game is its simplicity, because here you do not need to strain too hard to complete the level (in some cases you will have to). Of course, one cannot ignore the not-sharp graphics and unpleasant soundtrack. The low price and the availability of cards can also be attributed to the keys. The only disadvantage is the lack of settings. For example, I would like to change the screen resolution ... well, that's someone like. In general, the game is worth its money and you can buy it with peace of mind! 8/10 ",1,0

"The thing is undoubtedly useful (as for me), for 600 (!) Rubles you get things for tens of thousands of the same rubles. Yes, these things cannot be exchanged and sold, but this is how you have to be an Ebil in order to give players the opportunity to sell and exchange these expensive skins for only 600 rubles, so everything is logical here and there is no need to cry. Skins are beautiful, new. Basically, these are skins for clothes, but there are also a couple of skins for weapons. By purchasing this event pass, you will have the opportunity to keep all the skins you have earned for yourself forever, and this is very cool, because , I repeat, these clothes are very expensive and colorful. I consider the price of 600 rubles to be absolutely not overstated for such a mountain of new content, because in addition to skins, 21-30 levels of the event are also opened for you, for the achievement of which expensive things drop out. Take it without hesitation. This is much more profitable than just buying 600 rubles worth of skins on the trading platform. ",1,0

"Review after 740+ hours. Getting into the game is pretty tough - especially when you're alone. At the beginning you have to get used to all the perks / maps and killers. Main objective of the survivors -> repair 5 generators and escape through one of the two exit gates. Main goal as a killer -> Kill the 4 survivors As mentioned, getting into the game is relatively tough. However, once you have gained a little experience, the game is twice as much fun. I recommend the game zsm. to play with friends, because firstly this is even more fun and secondly you can always count on yourself to save each other. Small tips: Never just try to escape - only if no one comes to rescue. Please don't just run out, pay attention to your team. Don't camp, go in search of new victims -> that makes more points for you and also more fun. Kill 4 !! - if you should only get 3 and the last one is hiding, then do not hang the 3rd and look for the 4th because it is better to get 4 than 3 even if you only get 2. No killer is unbeatable and there is a counterplay against everyone, even if these are extremely difficult against a good nurse (strongest killer), they are feasible. If you have further questions or need help, just add me. I am happy to help you. You can keep misspellings =) ",1,0

"This game has made me meet friends, and make enemys. This is by far one of the best game I've played during my time on the platform called steam. In this game, you can build a base, get it raided, get triggered, leave the server, and then find a new server, or.. make your own and be the ruler of your players. To respond to your broken base, go and raid someone elses base and make it your own. Don't forget to make another wall around to to avoid the owners from coming back and getting to your loot! I've played in the 2.0 unturned and was there for the start of 3.0 unturned. I've had around 500+ hours in 2.0 alone and my friends got me to play 3.0 when dev test was just made. The game just surprised me to see the jump and dedication that went into this game. The creator, Nelson Sexton, put his heart and his life into this game and made it the game that I've always wanted to play. My first time playing this game in 2.0 I was dieing from zombies, not knowing how to do anything. And just got better from the game not being hard for starters, with the easy going start with some challenges if I chose to do them, I started to take buildings and make them my home. Then I would just find other loot that was around me, took it in, and survived. Which made me just play this game till very late in the night and going to bed, waking up and wanting to play it even more. Then.. I started to do 3.0, and I was just surprised by how the changes were with the main menu. Joined in dev test and saw just how everything was and how so different everything was! Then very later down the road, when unturned was getting very famous and was blowing up in the good way, I started to play on a lot of servers, people would just role play, kill, or take you in, give you food, and help you survive and let you on your way. The game is just one of the amazing one in my own thoughts and many others would agree with me. If you give this game a chance, then you will find your game that you will never give up. If you were to play unturned, start from the beta and go to the 2.0 and then play a bit and go to 3.0 and just look at the changes and take it all in. This is just my thoughts! ",1,0

"This adventure must belong to the career of every adventurer. Under the aegis of Wadjet Eye Games, which published pearls such as the Blackwell saga and propitiated the birth of Gemini Rue, Vince Twelve gave birth to this valuable narrative work, as well as a podium adventure. The works of Wadjet Eye Games are characterized by very deep stories, never banal, which highlight adult themes, creating discomfort in the player, certainly, but which shake him from his peaceful quiet life, from the consolidated patterns of human behavior that form an acquired cliché. Betrayals, personal gains, dramas, death .... underground conspiracies that are not an end in themselves, but insinuate themselves in the soul of the characters, and therefore in that of the player. Let's see some points in particular PROS GRAFICA. But when you see video games with graphics with obvious pixels, is it the developer who lags or is it the work of artists? Vince Twelve states that the choice of this technique, and the 320x240 resolution, is an artistic choice. In the production of the graphic of this game there is a lot of professional work, and the player notices it: the animations of the characters that do not seem never approximate, as if there was a complex 3D model in the background that expresses itself on the surface through the pixels, exuding the emotions that at that moment pass in the soul of the characters. SOUND. Ahhh, the sound. The characters express themselves with the voices of professional actors, this sound inflames the individual characters with meaning, each with its own defined personality and past history. It is a pleasure to hear them talk, discuss, get angry, grieve, talk about this and that .... The soundtrack, on the other hand, is only well done, not exceptional, sufficient to express the atmosphere of the case. RIDDLES. Tough, but never, never, never far-fetched. Very often an enigma blocks progress because we do not have the necessary ingredients, be they objects or memories (see next point). Other times you have to remember to have elements available that have escaped attention at the moment. Patience, wit, attention must always be at the side of the adventurer, nor must the provident Fortune that always accompanies him in his brilliant career be lacking. LONG AND SHORT EXPIRY MEMORY. This is an original mechanism invented and used, I believe, only in this game. It consists in making available to the player, in the various dialogue options, fragments of memory regarding past events. Long-term memories are memories of happened events that the game keeps in a list and that it automatically makes available to recall them in dialogues or simply to review them; the game may then remove them once they are no longer useful. The list of short-term memories, on the other hand, is completely managed by the player, who can place any element present in the scenario, be they people or objects: in this way each character can ask about any element of the game that can be enucleated from the scenery! HISTORY. What would adventures be without a story? Sometimes subtle, but the vast majority of the time essential. It is the story that keeps the adventurer attached to the monitor, it is the story that binds him by holding him tight in the coils of his unraveling, in his promise of wonderful developments, unexpected but cumunque worthy of being revealed. And this game has a Master story. But in dark colors, dramatic, moving, ... deadly. CHARACTERS. There are four, which can be maneuvered at will. Live, real, exuding feelings, equipped with expressive voices. CONS CHARACTERS. Sometimes cumbersome to shift control from one character to another. ACTION. The flaw, unexpected for an adventure of this caliber, consisting in the impossibility of interrupting an action taken was astonishing to me. TONGUE. Lack of Italian translation. Occasionally I was unable to catch some jokes because they were too fast and I went back to the previous save to hear them again. BUG. I only encountered one: after activating the steam overlay the game shows the dialogue lines at impressively high speeds. The remedy is that of an esc and resume or a reload of the RESONANCE save. And suddenly, in the world of adventures and videogames, the magnificent echo of this adventure resounded that from its throne loudly calls adventurers to itself. ",1,0

"[2018 OG review]: I promise I'm not simply writing this review to complete a task for the 2018 Autumn game nomination awards. But if you want my genuine opinion, this game has a lot of problems. Hitboxes and generally the actual damage / hits are the biggest issue and honestly my only real complaint. It's broken. They fix things, but it doesn't fix every issue. I think it has to do with the servers or hell maybe even the engine the games running on? I haven't a clue, I'm not a game developer. This game is fun with friends and even though it gets aggravating you continue to play it, making you more and more depressed.  I finally got out of purgatory and stopped playing this games a few months ago. Honestly tho, I had some great memories playing this game. If it's on sale, buy it. [2020 update review]: I still agree with everything I said. I still haven't played in so long. Maybe they fixed the hitboxes and game-breaking updates, I'm not sure. However, I kinda miss the days when I played this game. It's just like any competitive game. You hate it, but you can't stop playing it. This is slowly becoming a ""classic"" to me. Once again, pick it up if you like tactical shooters. ",1,0

"Amazing, frightening, intriguing, atmospheric all of this can be attributed to the new game in the Resident Evil series - Revelations. The game is sustained in the best traditions of the old parts, it has everything that is so lacking in the latest games in the series: the atmosphere, puzzles, well-designed locations, everyone's favorite characters in the lead roles, a solid plot, and it is also worth noting new pronounced and memorable characters. Everything here is as it should be in the Biohazard series. There are also disadvantages to this game, but they fade in the background of the whole game. Of the most important drawbacks, it is worth noting that it is quite short, even with a meticulous study of every detail in the game, but this does not make it less saturated from this. And the main disadvantage of the game is the miserable, ugly, just AWESOME localization of our great and mighty, so if your knowledge of English is at a sufficient level, then immediately play in English! It is also worth noting the newfangled narration of the plot in the ""serial"" style, which gives a special charm to the game, as well as an excellent porting of the game for the PC: Improved graphics, convenient control are all that little porting can boast of now. So if you are a Resident Evil lover, you shouldn't skip this game. I also recommend everyone else to read. ",1,0
"A very fun game in which you have to be the lord of darkness (this is how it was intended, but it is up to you to be a hero or a villain). It has everything a good game needs: an open world, many characters, and humor). The main advantage and difference from other games of the genre is the management of the suite. Yes, exactly the retinue. She is a kind of creatures, similar to small goblins, which are called henchmen. You can order them to attack other creatures or move something. They also pick up whatever they find. They put on armor and arm themselves with weapons. Lots of bosses and difficult moments. The game will make you sweat and throw your mind. Very nice graphics. The game will not make you bored. ★ Rating: 9/10. (WORTH TAKING!). Moreover, this miracle is worth -99 r, about $ 3. ",1,0

"This is my first review of a game and therefore my most important game. At the tender age of 10, I was watching a movie with my friends without any expectation and without any information about the movie. The film quickly pulled all 4 of us under its spell and more, it disturbed us. To be honest, I was soaked for 2 weeks with fear, dark rooms were taboo from then on. And now it comes, some things continue to this day (thanks not to the wetting of evolution). It's the movie Alien. It would go too far to describe how I slowly returned to the subject of horror films and horror games. One thing is certain, at some point I was sitting at my computer and a familiar scene is displayed on 27 inches. Feelings like almost 40 years ago reappeared. The game Alien Isolation immediately cast a spell on me, as it did then. It was an incredible experience to be able to play the game, albeit with many interruptions. By the way, I had to insert the interruptions because of the incredible tension that arose in me. I find everything in this game, everything that is important to me and what I'm looking for in a game. It has atmosphere, a wonderful set, a good story, reasonably good dialogues and stringent people, puzzles that can be solved, many challenges and a great arc of tension, which for my taste was a bit overstretched (whining at the highest level), but actually just the right mix of tension and relaxation, something that I unfortunately miss in today's cinema. In short, it was an incredible experience and I would like to thank the developers ""Creative Assembly"" and ""Feral Interactivedem"" and the publisher ""Sega"" for this wonderful game. Of course I would be happy about a second part. Until then, I'll probably play this game over and over again. To all alien fans: LLAP ",1,0

"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you're a Call of Duty player, you're going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it's always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤPersonal Rating: 10/10 ",1,0

"Good and also the only game of its kind (apart from Friday the 13th, which almost died and the stillborn Deathgarden). Dead by Daylight invites you to play as two sides: the Assassin (14 characters to choose from), the merciless hound of the Essence, and the Survivors (15 characters), who are helpless victims, on 12 different maps (not counting their various variations). The main task of the Assassin is to hang the Survivors on ritual hooks in order to please the local god aka Essence, while preventing them from starting generators (5 pieces), since when these are started, the Meat will open the gate and simply run away! The gameplay for the killer is very interesting and varied, because unlike the survs (they only change the model), his ""ability"" changes. For example, in one game you catch Meat in traps, and in another you already chop it with a chainsaw, etc. Sometimes the hitman game is very difficult, since you still play one against four (it is especially difficult if these players are experienced and play with a connection). But even in this case, the killer has something to answer to the insolent feed of the Essence (add-ons, offerings). The main task of any Survivor is quite simple - start the generators, open the gate and leave (complicated by the killer's skill). Also, the Survivors can perform additional actions, namely: engage in altruism (rescue and heal less successful teammates), run from the killer (which requires a lot of experience). One of the main advantages of survivors is the ability to play with communication (discord, skype, etc.), but this, of course, introduces a very large imbalance for the killer. The game features a huge variety of skins. Some can be obtained for free by simply playing the game, and some can only be obtained for real money, but customization in this game has almost no effect on it. 1) Sometimes there are very unpleasant bugs and errors. For example, everyone is already tired of the very long waiting for the lobby for the Killer at certain ranks (they promise to fix it soon). 2) Toxic community. Unfortunately, some part of the community of this game is just the repulsed dregs of society, which may have migrated from the hidden pool of Dota. They will prove to you in every possible way that you must play by their ""rules"", etc., but if you do not follow these rules, then you will immediately find out that you have another father, hear wishes about an imminent death and etc. But in general, the game is very suitable and will tighten the amateur for a long time.

"A masterpiece. Must have if you like platformers / run & guns. Maybe a little too difficult for newcomers to the genre, for everyone else it will be a great challenge.

"The game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. Describing Divinity is beyond the scope of my motivation to write a review so in short words. Divinity maintains solid RPG ground play. They know what they are good at and the world feels very much alive in the sense that your actions affect the world there are 100 possibilities for everything - both in the execution and in the result and especially now that I am playing it with you again Friend and I do things exactly as I've done them before because I want loot or want to do funny quests again, I notice ... they don't happen, he or I did something that turned the quest completely upside down, I see new things and things like that make a good RPG for me.

"One of the good examples of a good survival game in a zombie apocalypse. A plus of the game are battles with zombies, with some you need to change tactics, such as a suicide, a brute, a butcher or a ram, someone is slow, and someone is fast and can run after you, or kill with one hit. Knives, machetes, katanas, axes and guns for every taste + upgrade system. All tasks are very monotonous, of the type: ""run to point A, kill everyone at point B"", which was very annoying. Also, not everywhere there is fast movement and cars, so you have to run decent distances back and forth, risking death, losing part of your money after each death. In the course of the passage, new locations gradually open up to us, be it the jungle, very reminiscent of the first Far Cry and Crysis, or the city, as if referring us to Dying Light, which came out later from the pen of the same studio. There is also the ""Arena"" mode where you can test yourself for strength. Rating 7/10 ",1,0

"Sunny meadows and forests, beautiful women, beer, but also thieves and paws ... These are the Czech lands of 1403. This is the Kingdom Come Deliverance. Creating an innovative singleplayer game in 2018 is difficult (at a time when games must include pay to win mechanics, loot boxes, etc.), it has succeeded in completing Warhorse's study with its Kingdom Come Deliverance. The game is set in the early 15th century. That is, times when you simply cannot find modern technology, healthcare or certain moral principles. You start as Jindra, the son of a former Prague blacksmith in the village of Stříbrná Skalice. They are immediately attacked and burned by Sigismund's troops, and you have no choice but to flee. Then. . . (The story is good, it has its humor and storytelling style, so I won't spoiler anymore). The game mechanics are really diverse, from playing dice in a local pub to an amazing combat system. It's hard, but once it literally gets in your hand, you can beat anyone, anytime. ""Anytime?"" Well, if you're hungry or drunk or sleepless, your stamina and health will be reduced, so you have to stick to all these standards just right. ""And how right?"" For example, if you eat too much, you will be overeating (food slowly but surely spoils and poisoning can occur, so be careful). Or if you drink that beautiful golden alcoholic drink too much, you will be fine for a while (statuses will increase for a while), but then a hangover follows and we all know what a hangover is ... Unfortunately, there are also negatives. Certain quests are special and a few game bugs can also be found. Czech dubbing, not Czech dubbing, damn it. Kingdom Come Deliverance deserves to be among the greats like Horizon Zero Dawn or The Sorcerer. I hope that the second part will be published someday and that it will captivate the whole world again. 8.5 / 10 Kumans recommended. ",1,0

"Highly recommended, with the unofficial definitive edition patch (which brings various mods that improve the experience), it plays perfectly in widescreen and 60 fps. I also recommend large map mods and saved anywhere, as I felt necessary for my taste. The story is not very there, although the arcade emphasis that this installment provides I think is unique, because lacking so much personality (I understand that when it came out it did have it, but today it is more than stolen) it is enjoyed like no other, Well, the missions are short at 60 fps, since everything is more fluid and it doesn't feel like time is wasted so much. I have enjoyed it a lot, although there have been missions that were tedious: -They find such a car to carry out the mission (they do not show you a photo of what it is like or where to find it, and if they tell you where to find it, you do not know where it is because there is a large map and it is not marked on the minimap) -They get to such a place that they do not mark you on the minimap in less than x time, (yes, ""Espresso-2-Go!"", I'm talking to you) Those types of missions I recommend a guide unless you want to waste hours of your life looking for things that you don't even know what they are based on trial and error. The radio is cool, although not as impressive as San Andreas or GTA 4. The gameplay is extremely fun at 60 fps. I recommend playing it whatever the year, with the patches mentioned above. ",1,0

"I've been interested in a lot since the days of Robotomi, and I personally liked the story too. So I had a lot of anticipation for the news that a sequel was coming out... Honestly, in the early years of Early Access,'this game is fun!' Personally, I think there are few people who think. There were complex rules and other inconvenient elements in the inconvenient UI. Of course, you only need to get used to the rules, but the other elements were too annoying to play silently. So at the time, it seemed like I played with the feeling of seeing a novel rather than a game. I try to see what the next story is somehow... But I want to say that over time, I could understand how hard the project moon developers are working on this game, and it touched me a lot, even if I only play. This game is'fun!' as you quickly feel in real time that bugs and problems that are quickly fixed or inconvenient things are improving in real time! I started to feel. Currently, I am playing the game satisfactorily. In particular, if a game that is still in the incomplete stage like Early Access does not try to fill in the scarcity, but simply covers it, I think the possibility of the game will end there. That is why I am looking forward to the final result of this game just by feeling the fun and possibility of this game while feeling the real-time solving of many problems in the early days like Louisa.

"The game is divine, so get a recipe for pancakes from me. Recipe for pancakes: Take milk and eggs out of the refrigerator in advance so that they reach room temperature. Whisk eggs into a bowl, mix with sugar and salt. Add sugar even if you are using unsweetened toppings (liver or stewed cabbage). Thanks to him, the dough will be tastier. Add milk, mix well. Place a sieve on a bowl and add flour to it. This will remove any lumps and create an airy, delicate texture. The flour should be added to the dough for thin pancakes in several steps, stirring constantly with a whisk. The consistency of the finished composition should resemble liquid sour cream. This will make it easier to bake pancakes in milk: the dough will easily spread over the pan and will not crumple when turning over. Add vegetable oil and stir. Pancakes on kefir with boiling water Ingredients Pancakes on kefir with boiling water 400 ml of kefir; 200 ml of water; 2 eggs; 250 g flour; 2 tbsp. tablespoons of vegetable oil; 3 tbsp. tablespoons of sugar; 0.5 tsp of soda; a pinch of salt. Method of preparation Beat eggs with sugar and salt. Add kefir, sifted flour and whisk. Boil water, stir baking soda in it and pour in a thin stream into the dough, stirring well. If the dough is not thin enough, add a little more warm water. Add 1 tbsp to the dough. spoon of vegetable oil and mix. Let the dough stand for 5-7 minutes. Grease a preheated pan with vegetable oil, pour the dough with a ladle and fry the pancakes on kefir for 1 minute on each side. Serve hot kefir pancakes with sour cream, jam, honey or berries. ",1,0

"Its a good modern era shooter, however, does not hold a candle to even the original PSX port that came out in 1995. The level design has less personality compared to the classic wads, and without Aubrey Hodges brilliant ambience this new doom falls short in comparison.  On the bright side, the performance is smooth and the textures are impressive. All in all, a good modern shooter, only a decent doom title. ",1,0
"This is a really weird game, that's both smarter and dumber than it ought to be. It has a very, very dark view on 1950's America (well deserved, but still), and will without question require a 'trigger warning' for anyone with Political right-leaning views who can't laugh at themselves as it has a very dim view on that side of the aisle.  That aside, it is fun, although the common review complaint: too many cutscenes (skipable or not) is a major problem, probably the biggest problem; it really breaks the follow of the game and is jarring at times as you go from in combat to totally peaceful, in a new location, in a cutscene.  The gameplay is solid though, and the ever expanding inventory of classic sci-fi/B-Movie/Shlock Alien movie weapons (including an anal probe because of course it would) makes it feel varied in how you conduct yourself. It is interesting the game included both a stealth approach system (scanning and wearing a human's apperance) and a 'loud' approach system, although I feel as though the missions themselves could have done more to encourage either approach as most seemed geared, or outright forced, in one way or the other.  It's clearly an older game in both feel and fun and I'd recommend it with the caveat to remember that many of the problems mentioned above are borne from more than 10 years of game development since the base of this game was made that has refined many of the concepts in it.

"Where do I start. At a young age I was addicted to the first game. I would play it for hours on end finishing the game with each unique character and mastering their specific play style. This game to me was ""Icing on cake"".  When it comes to harsh survival situations, resource management and fast paced hand-to-hand combat, this game ticks all boxes.  This game also involves personal strategies when it comes to kill Zombies/mutations: Do I attack the group of mobs head on? Or attack them from a distant with explosives and firearms. The storyline is interesting to say the least, when it comes to crazed tribe men to rich military bastards, you can't help but have an envy to kill them and get off the god forsaken island.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that can swallow high levels of gore and get entertained as much as I do from heads and body parts flying and staining a beautiful but deadly beach.

"Oh, hi! Are you waiting for a new useless review? And here he is, and today I will tell you about the most beautiful game - Amnesia. What is it? is a horror quest that has become a classic. The game tells the story of a young man named Daniel. That's all you need to know at this stage, In the meantime, everything you love is the pros and cons of this game. + Atmosphere. It is she who is the key moment of the horror component, creepy, dark and constantly in a different setting. + The plot. It is revealed here gradually, through the notes and flashbacks of the YG. There are no sharp turns here, but even without this it is interesting to observe its development. + Puzzles. They are moderately complex, but require attention to detail and reading notes. + Horror component. Here it is excellent, they do not frighten you with screamers and other garbage, but they do it very competently and in moderation. + Physics. It's great, and most of the gameplay is tied to it. + Soundtrack. It is also capable of scaring, every rustle, every scream can make you lay down bricks. Well, I sort of listed all the pluses. And now let's move on to what any game cannot do without. -II. He is stupid here, and monsters sometimes just dissolve in some unknown place. -Pulling puzzles. Some will take you two minutes, while others won't even half an hour. Well, that's all I wanted to convey to you. My rating is 9/10, as it is a great horror. ",1,0

"If Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett had teamed up to make Skyrim for the Super Nintendo waaay back in the 1990s, the end result would have been... well, probably terrible, as neither of them were game developers.  Luckily they never tried, so the developers of Mad Nords were free to unleash their own silly version of this nifty mashup on the world. Mad Nords:  Probably an Epic Quest is a retro-styled RPG that features weird, quirky humor along with the open world and quest-branching system of an Elder Scrolls or Fallout game.  The player starts out as a level 1 cannibal/bureaucrat/(insert unusual class of choice) looking for a cucumber for his wife in the next town over. Of course, this simple fetch quest won't be as easy as it should be, and so begins the main questline. As you are continually redirected to new locations to continue with your main, cucumber-seeking quest, the overwhelming temptation to fall into the usual RPG standard of speaking to every person and breaking into every house will eventually get the better of you.  A few hours later, you'll realize that you've explored several towns and dungeons, completed a dozen sidequests, and geared yourself up with a stupendous bladed fork of +3 strength and 15% critical chance - but never really got any closer to finding that cucumber.  Which is just as it should be, as any player who has spent hundreds of hours on an Elder Scrolls game without actually beating the main quest can tell you. Mad Nords' retro graphics and strange sense of humor are pleasantly enjoyable, making this game a fun way to while away a Saturday morning.  The game offers an abundance of fairly amusing quests, plenty of magical loot, and quite a few useful skills to invest in as you level to offer some RPG-progression.  Each starting class also features a few unique skills, which adds variety and even replayability if you want to try a different character.  I do not know how much content the end product will have (this is an Early Access title), but I do know that I came nowhere close to finding my cucumber after several hours of playtime.    Mad Nords is an entertaining parody of open-world questing with a very reasonable pricetag.  I would definitely recommend trying out this quirky game if you get a chance. ",1,0

"It's a shame that 2D platform games enjoyed such a brief time in the sun, superseded by more advanced 3D games. As such it's always a nice surprise when you stumble across a good one whilst trawling through the extensive Steam library and even better when you can pick it up on sale. If your a veteran or new to games I think you will find there's plenty of content to keep your interest. With a charming humour laced storyline and great character development I found it difficult to put this gem of a game down. Animation is top notch with all the care and attention to detail instantly noticeable. Very slick (though basic) combat with good character skill development and the ability to craft (also basic).  Dust: An Elysian Tail was the brainchild of independent designer Dean Dodrill and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2012, and it was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows on Steam on May 24, 2013.

Great story with developed characters, pleasant looking art style, smooth combat mechanics, an awesome soundtrack etc... this game is a must-have for those who are fans of the RPG genre and it's well worth the price, but get it on sale if you can.

KurtzPel is an anime MMORPG game in which you create your own waifu and go to homeless people. This is the SoulWorker killer game in which I spent 100 hours. This is the kind of game that attracts with its combat, it just draws me into ecstasy. And yes, you can be stuttered here and shot into the stratosphere. A little about the pros + 1) FIGHT! 2) Graphics. 3) Character editor. 4) Rating battles. 5) Donat does not bite, it is only for clothes. (Is it possible to get a new class so far only by donation) 6) Soundtrack more or less. And cons - 1) Occasionally, but there are bugs. 2) Will not fit on many buckets. 3) You need to wait when it comes off the bat. 4) You cannot go to a party with 2+ players. 5) Few modes and maps. 6) There is no open world, although ... I hope they will do it. (Only in my dreams) Verdict: The game is good, so also free. But the bitch is demanding. The battle is excellent, which makes it a pleasure to beat homeless people.

"There's no denying this game is gorgeous and unsettling at the same time. With the same foreboading atmosphere of the survival horror genre; lonliness, fear of the unknown, and a AI companion who's goal is to give you as little information as possible. I had a lovely time examining my surroundings and finding tiny pieces of a story i don't fully know yet.  Yet, that's where it all stops for me. The concept of the AI is intruiging, but just doesn't translate well in this game. The AI knowns as Kaizen is barely responsive in any meaningful way, and it's easy to make it hate you. Interacting with it really did feel like trying to get my girlfriend to tell me what's wrong; it just would rather say nothing and change the subject. As a major selling point for the game, it's unacceptable. Regardless of this, i overall, still enjoied my time with the game.    --- Waaaaay too short of a game for it's asking price. Wait for a sale.  ---Only play this game if you're really interested in isolation simulators, for that, it's still worth playing. ",1,0

"Sea of Thieves is one of the most polished games I have experienced in recent memory. Its environment, immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play, explore and experience. The campaign stories (called ""Tall Tales"") are intriguing, inventive and curious to play-through. When it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns, it feels a bit lackluster and basic. Battling enemies head-on lacks challenge and is relatively simple. That said, the ship battles against Skeleton Ships, Ghost Ships, Kraken, Megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique. The amount of ways to mess around with your opponent, blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time. Moments where you T-Bone an enemy ship, grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that I have yet to see matched in other games. To add, depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4, you will be provided larger ships from a single-said Sloop to a massive Galleon, all with their own benefits and short-comings, making battles incredibly challenging. Another key part of the game is the progression in the game. For some players, the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing. However, if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards, this may be the game for you. In Sea of Thieves, what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks, access to better weaponry/ships or other in the game. The quests, currencies and rewards are all related to cosmetics to improve the look and feel of yourself and your ship. ",1,0

"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is amazing game. It is such a shame that Publisher of Troika Games (Activision) wanted to rush the release of the game, before it was finished. To make it worse, it was released on possibly the worst day to launch a game: SAME DAY AS HALFLIFE 2! maybe the biggest game of all time. Both Bloodlines and Half-life 2 use the same source engine, difference is that Troika was given the alpha version of the Source engine, that was very buggy and not finished at the time. Thanks to the fans, it's now possible to play the game using patch, that makes the game playable. The graphics are outdated since its released in 2004, but that didn't bother me that much to be honest. This game has AMAZING dialog and writing, the facial animations are surprisingly good for older game and every character in this game has something interesting to say. Pros: * Writing and story * Sound & Atmosphere * There is multiple ways to complete objective * You are rewarded if you choose to complete some quests avoiding violence and use your wits instead * There is ton of variety in missions and locations * It's very fun and immersive game about Vampire life * It's fun to use all those Vampire themed abilities and drink from enemies to replenish your powers * That same dance animation on everyone :D Cons: * You need to install the fan patch to make it playable * Some areas look pretty unfinished compared to others * There is sometimes huge difficulty spike on some missions Total: Graphics - 7 Sound - 9 Gameplay - 8 Story - 9 Writing - 10 --- I would rate this game ""MUST PLAY"" Now I await with horror what the new Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will be with the new developers and their biased views.

"This game is about a director recording a commentary over an old movie he directed, to release a DVD version. In the game, you control some characters in the film, and almost every action you do, or locations you reach, the director has some comment to make. About gameplay, it is an action game with top-down view (sometimes the camera makes a difference, despite). It's very easy to play and simple to understand, but a lot of fun. The look of the game is too charming, it has enemies that are dolls recorded in stop motion, or animatronics, or actors dressed as alien, etc. You can see cables that hold bats while they fly, very low budget and old style.

"- to begin with the prehistory, how I got acquainted with this game, who is not interested, skip down, directly, to the review itself. This game - I do not have it on my account, I got it directly with family access, through another account, after which I spent the finest, not wasted hours, in this game, passing it, and 2 DLCs released for it. In the story, we play as a middle-aged man named Booker Davitt, who came to Columbia in search of a girl named Elizabeth, with the goal of returning her to New York, thereby paying off her debts. Then the plot unfolds in a very unexpected plan, therefore, this information about the plot should be enough, about the essence of why we came to Colombia. If I say that the graphics are 10 out of 10, I, of course, will lie, but if I say that the graph is backward, the same thing will happen, it all depends from what point of view you are considering it, in other words, the puddles are worked out very competently and beautifully , it's nice to watch the light in the game, the reflections, but if you cite the flowers from the beginning of the second add-on of this game (Sea Grave episode 2) as an example, then you can not say anything about some textures. (2D color textures! It struck me very much, and upset me, the developers made these textures for a ""blunder"", this is rather a jamb of designers, a big minus for this. The gameplay of the game is simply amazing: shootouts, plasmids, placing trap plasmids, I have data I really liked the manipulations of the game in the field of gameplay, it is very addictive.Of course, there is not an abundance of guns, but everyone can choose something of their own, with the energy drinks the same story, everyone will find their own pair of them, given that there are as many as 8 of them in the game ! Which in my opinion is not a little. Eh, the melody is immediately remembered when the game is loaded, or from the main menu, after completing this game, you are unlikely to forget it, the music in this game, created exclusively to give an atmosphere to the world, will not come down for ordinary listening , but it's not so bad, hearing these melodies can again plunge into the stunning world of BioShock Infinite, and subconsciously visit Colombia again, it pleases, I liked the music, here, as they say - the taste and color. Llekt rivals in the game leaves much to be desired, because sometimes they do not see you in the butt, here, after all, at times, minus this toy. In my opinion, the world of this game is unique thanks to: good musical accompaniment, unique characters, high-quality gameplay, and most importantly, the elaboration and idea of ​​this world, Colombia itself, portals and the movement between them. I was hooked! And so, I got acquainted with the game back in 2013 - 2014, but unfortunately I gave up, there was no craving to play games, later, I started playing it on PS3, but also to no avail, (I reached Slate, I didn't even get a shock jockey) and so, after so much time, I gave myself access from a second account, which I bought on the cheap, and passed this creation, to say that I am satisfied is to say nothing, because I would not write this review now. How well did I go through the game? Hmm, 76 out of 80 voiceophones in the main storyline company, opened all the safes in the game locked with master keys, (except for one), the maximum number of lockpicks is 30, at the end of the game there are still about 11 - 17, conclusion: there are plenty of lockpicks in the game, with the possibility of buying them in one vending machine. On what difficulty did I complete the game? Passed on Hard difficulty, sometimes difficult, but for the most part the game is easy even at this difficulty level, the more, the game has its own troubles, how you can ""easily"" kill all the enemies who played, most likely I will understand, since everyone there is a favorite plasmid or an energy drink, and a favorite cannon in their hands, respectively, and the tactics in the game are different for everyone. Separately, I would like to note both the characters of our main characters, and those who accompany them throughout the game (well, you understand, there is a small spoiler) I was it's very nice to play as Booker Davitt, and I would also like to add something about the main character. As a character - Elizabeth is worked out simply magnificently, in terms of detailing, female nature, character, and individual character traits, a character that will definitely be remembered! Also, I would like to note that in his interview, Ken Levin (creator of the Bioshock series of games) noted that they created Elizabeth from scratch, and did not use Lara Croft for this, as some studios do, and also noted that even the developers were asked to follow behavior of their friends and wives, in order to learn as much as possible about the female nature and improve the character, and, fortunately, Elizabeth cannot be called an ordinary character;) Well, this is my review, I will wait for discounts on this wonderful game, in hope to buy it in the future and maybe stream it for hard difficulty, if you still manage to do this activity, and I ask you to rate my review, and the screenshots I made in this game, you can even add to your favorites, thank you all, and bye, good game!

"For starters, I am a huge fan of Borderlands. I loved the first, spent over 500 hours on the second. What about Pre Sequel? Meh .. At the beginning I believed in the bitch, I saw in Pre Sequel just a big DLC ​​of Borderlands 2 with new characters ... The hours of games go by and I have come to certain conclusions. (SPOILER WARNING) /! \ Before reading all this I advise you to watch the trailers above on this page, you will better understand what I mean for those who have never touched any of the Borderlands. The positive points: -New characters, therefore, with new gameplay, new skill trees, customizations, etc. -The gameplay is divided into two phases. In an oxygen-free environment allowing immense jumps but which gradually consume your oxygen and in an environment with oxygen where the jumps are reduced but where the fire element weapons acquire their full potential. -Lots of easter eggs like in Borderlands 2. A reference to Star Wars, Pink Floyd, Mario, Daft Punk etc .. -New vehicles, new maps to explore, new enemies to destroy, new bosses to exterminate. -Borderlands The Pre Sequel is HARD. When I compare to the two previous opus, I find it more complex yes, the enemies resist well, do more damage which generates fights which are technical and of which more interesting. -little DLC. Again, compared to Borderlands 1 and 2, Pre Sequel features little DLC. I also recall that Borderlands 2 has 10 add ons without counting the skins. -A JETPACK. And we can play Claptrap..wow what more can we say. -Grotesque punchlines, cult lines and lots of humor with Borderlands sauce as we like. -A new weapon category, lasers and a new element, ice replacing slag. -A rather nice story located between Borderlands first of the name and Borderlands 2. We learn about Jack's past and the reason for his viceral hatred against bandits and hunters in the ark. The negative points: -The interface, the presentation, the graphics, even some legendary weapons of the previous games are THE SAME as in Borderlands 2. I find it a shame that a game released 2 years later is also predecessor. new content .. that's why this game reminds me of a huge DLC. -Many legendary weapons can only be obtained with the Crusher, a recycling-type crafting system that is easy to use but quite random. Okay, we'll have to farm the same mob 60 times more to get the long-awaited weapon, but ... at least this practice was causing us some hype. Moreover, few bosses or mobs that loot the legendary are farmable. Pity. -The difficulty as mentioned above can be an advantage for some but also a disadvantage for others. Dying 17 times against the same monster is quite frustrating indeed. It's up to you. -Few categories of monsters. The fauna of Elpis is much less impressive than that of Pandora. -A short lifespan. Indeed, the game is not very long and can be finished in 2 days by ordinary players. -Bugs in textures, enemies that cross the ground etc but nothing too serious seriously affecting the gameplay. I must have forgotten some details. In conclusion I will simply say that this game is good without being incredible. However, I would have liked to see more innovations from the developers in 2 years. Cartoon style graphics still have their charm. PC level, Borderlands The Pre Sequel is a little bigger than Borderlands 2 without requiring a monstrous configuration. Finally I advise you to wait for the sales to buy it. Yes it is a good game BUT in my opinion it is not really worth the price. All of this is obviously my opinion and it was very hard to remain as neutral as possible as I love the universe of Borderlands. See you soon in game ... or for the release of Borderlands 3! * hype over 9000 * ",1,0
The game is quite fun; the port isnt perfect but it is constanly getting patched and worked on. I have had a lot of fun returning to the monster hunter franchise through this game. I would reccommend it to anyone who enjoys co-op or a decent singleplayer experience. ,1,0
"Civitatem is from the developer studio and from the publisher. Civitatem is a medieval city builder where you can help your villagers to start a new settlement in dangerous areas using your skills and available resources in the world. Shape the future of your employees by mentoring the villagers for every task. Research new technologies, fight the natural elements or the looters, explore the land for new villages, develop new trade routes, acquire new technologies and develop new diplomatic relations. You start in a strange, unexplored area where there is currently nothing but resources. There are many different jobs in Civitatem that you can give your villagers but at the beginning you should have 2 builders, 2 miners and 2 lumberjacks (at the beginning you only have 6 villagers) so that you can acquire the basic resources (this is also in the '' tutorial '') and start building a village. I recommend buying food and drinks on the first day, otherwise you will have problems on the second day with the residents having no more energy to work. There is currently no research done to me, but it is also not known whether another research system will be added. Before creating a new game, you can create a village chief, name him, enter your family name, decide whether he / she should be male or female and choose 2 out of 11 specifications and you can also decide how the village will be should be called. Then you can choose a level of difficulty (everyone has a different goal). There is a day / night cycle in which the villagers go to bed at certain times. There is also winter and summer in Civitatem. The professions are here: Wood cuter Builder Miner Forager Farmer Herblist Hunter Baker Blacksmith These are all current professions in Civitatem. There are many buildings and more are to come. The individual buildings are called (in English): Stockpile | Resources can be kept there House | Housing for the villagers Barn | Keep all food except Bread Well | Well where the residents can have a drink on their own Road | A street where residents can move a little faster Blacksmith | Builds Herblist Tools | Makes potions that can heal residents Hunting Lodge | Hunters (if you have any) who are there hunt animals for meat and fur Field | If you have seeds you can grow a field there Windmill | Produces grain which, among other things, the baker needs to make bread Bakery | Produces bread from the grain that you get from the windmill. At the moment these were all buildings in Civitatem. Civitatem has not been out very long, so there might be updates in the future, the innovations of which I have not considered in the review. -Nice soundtrack -Nice design -Low system requirements -Unfortunately not available in German -There is no real tutorial, but an 11-page text that you can read through (in the tips are available Civitatem is a nice game for in between and for only currently 12.99 € a real bargain. The game has a good soundtrack and is really fun. In my opinion, recommendable. Did you like the review? Then follow our. Suggestions for improvement or criticism in the comments. ",1,1

"It so happened that I noticed this product this spring, but he did not particularly inspire me and I decided to spend my hard-earned 61 rubles as usual on barbiturates ... As time went on, drug warehouses were empty, I had a decent amount of money for which I could afford buy a game called ""Broken Reality"" on Steam. In general, it is strange that I have never crossed paths with the developers of either game before, since we see what is happening with them is definitely very similar (guys, call me ...). In general, compared to the aforementioned game, BTW somehow did not hook at all, and therefore I put 4 packs of Zhoritos out of 10. On the other hand, there are not so many similar projects as I personally would like and I respect everyone at least for their originality, but at the same time with low price is generally a gift (no).

"An excellent remake, rethinking of the first halva. Somewhere they simplified the levels (with a trolley), somewhere they came up with their own options (they did not depart from the plot, just small amendments). I bought it in 2016, but when I got to Xena, they wrote ... it will be soon, 4 years have passed for me ... and here it is. I liked Zen very much, the locations became larger and livelier than in the original (organic caves, reminiscent of the Cavity from DS1). Zen is essentially a series of large asteroid islands with portals between them. The stones, as it was in the laboratory, there are a bunch of them, their use is justified, rather than in the first part, some flowers were pressed to pass. The plant was made top-quality. Optimization is better than it was, only a couple of times the game crashed during the passage of new levels, once it was saved near the door at the time of its opening, and when it opened, I was stuck in the ground, thanks. The music is pleasant. Weapon animations are generally well done. Xena took 8-9 hours to complete. For an indie project, top. ----- 9/10 ----- ",1,1

"Redneck Kentucky is a representative of budget games from City Interactive. Today, the company has a new name CI Games, strives for better quality of its titles and tries to forget its past. Probably due to the fact that her games used to be a symbol for waste and generic, mutually copying and buggy shooters were a welcome bite for reviewers with a sharp pen. Redneck Kentucky is basically such a ""bird"". However, not due to its (un) qualities, but its game content. The game is basically a reworked Moorhuhn into a form of 3D action. And it definitely belongs to the better titles from its Polish parent company. The farmer must defend his farm from the invasion of feathers born of a monstrous wooden hen. He has no choice but to take a shotgun (and later a machine gun, bazooka or sniper rifle) and go on the attack. The game takes place in a total of seven arenas and each of them has a different farm-like environment. The developers used a proven Unreal engine, including the most modern tweaks at the time, and the graphics look quite nice, in a successful cartoon style. The main task is to shoot as many feathers as possible within the time limit to reach the required number of points and open the next level. You run around the farm and shoot at everything that moves, so the feathers just fly. I originally thought that I was only waiting for a short time, but in order to open all the arenas, you have to think strategically and fulfill the specific tasks that each area includes. It is better to shoot more distant chickens, because there are more points for them. Fulfillment of the tasks displayed before the start of the mission is a necessary condition for an adequate point gain. You have to look for cans, shoot bird parasites from a pumpkin field, in the night map with the help of a flashlight you are looking for chicken ghosts. Elsewhere, you use dogs to collect eggs that fall from killed birds. In the interior level, you even protect the barn, in which the eggs fall directly into the crates. Different types of power-ups are also available. You will definitely not see all the nooks and crannies of the arenas on the first play, so it pays to repeat the survey, which you can't avoid if you really want to finish the game. I spent more than 6 hours defending the farm. It is not just to meet the required point limit of the arena, even if you do not put extra extra effort. But most importantly - in order for the game to be completed, you have to record 70,000 points, which took me much longer and I was already a little upset about croaking and country music. In the end, I won the access to the eighth level with a boss fight. You are eliminating the mentioned monstrous armored hen in it and the reward is a powerful explosion on the globe and thanks to the authors. Technically, the game ran solidly, without graphic defects and other problems. The only exception is chopping the game during the introductory video and most importantly - freezing the game when pressing the keys not used by the game, for example when taking a screenshot on Steam. In this case, at least for me, the game froze, but fortunately the switch to the desktop and back usually helped. As I mentioned, Redneck Kentucky is one of the better games from City Interactive. If you are not looking for a complex structure of levels or bombastic action moments, it is a suitable lightweight title for a short break. Pros: Fun theme. Striving for variety and different tasks in locations. Pleasant graphic design. Cons: Freezing game. Stereotype after prolonged playing. 65% ",1,0

"I won't write much, but I will share my impressions of this game. The game itself is a very wonderful interactive movie in which we have to solve the mystery about a local serial killer. To our great regret, the main character is killed at the beginning of the game .. That's right! After all, after death, he had new opportunities. Alas, we cannot interact with non-living objects, but we can move into the bodies of people and cats! : 3 I want to note that the world, though small, is quite lively! Little people walk, imitate communication - beauty! This adds a certain atmosphere to the town. But! Due to the fact that the streets are quite narrow, and even the ""walls of the past"" are thrown onto the road, it is quite easy to get confused where to go. The cinematic component is more interesting. The plot is catchy and intriguing! The behavior of the characters looks, well, appropriately believable, which is even more pleasant to watch! The downside is that the game is designed for one time only. But this time will leave a good impression! Passage without collecting items takes 5-6 hours. I think no more. Suitable game for leisure, detective lovers will love it. As Lev Tolstoy said: If you have read this creation, to the end, thank you! ",1,0

With over 1,000 unlockable weapons and hats, the game is always changing things up, It provides admittedly lackluster tutorials but also player coaches to teach new players. Casual is mostly unfocused and silly, and competitive is very serious with not much joking around. It's like two different games. Think about this before playing.

"Sally Face is barely a game but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play it. This is a story simulation with elements of basic puzzle solving and backtracking. Reminiscent of the point and click adventure games of the 1990s though its gameplay is not nearly as deep as say Lucas Arts' games of the bygone era - Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle or Grim Fandango to name a few.  The story will definitely keep you interested enough as you follow Sally Face, a boy with a horrible face disfigurement (I'm assuming this as till Episode 4 at least we haven't been shown his face) and the weird things he experiences when he moves into his new apartment with his father. The game, owing to its story and artwork, feels a lot like an art project with stories conveying certain underlying tones of family, sacrifice, nihilism and mental breakdown. Sally Face carries the story for most part though sometimes you also assume the role of other characters for short periods of time. These are well sketched and none of them feel like fillers just for the sake of diversifying the story. There are also supernaturals and demons as Sally Face interacts with those who have passed on to the other side. There will be a fair number of areas for one to explore in the game (Sally's school, some underground liar etc) but for most part the story builds itself in the apartment complex itself which seems to be afflicted by the presence of a cult and/or demonic entity.  The overarching quest is to investigate and stop this demon/cult and witness how this whole situations affects Sally and his friends in heart-breaking ways (Mini Spolier – Episode 4 is a bit of a Red Wedding). Sound and music compliments the game well, though it is a little too basic and while I personally feel that it needed more work, the rudimentary nature of the sound effects/music might actually be appealing to others. Once again, the real hero here is the story, which while it may not match up to the golden days of point-n-click, but will entice you enough for a single playthrough. Which is why it would be a great sale purchase to be spent with on an open weekend. 7/10 ",1,0

Secondly, if you are still running into issues, try fiddling around with Rockstar's so-called launcher. The first thing I noticed was that my game was not tied with my Rockstar account but after logging in again and giving it a few minutes, it activated.  Still have problems?

"Two years after the events of the first part, Max Payne - now cleared of all charges - works again for the New York Police Department. His next adventures begin when he is given the task of working out a group of professional killers called ""cleaners"". The investigation brings surprising results quickly. Max stumbles upon Mone Sax, whom he thought was dead, and several other people from the past. They will make him realize that the truth about the death of his wife and daughter is not complete. Max Payne 2, like the original, is a shooter in which the action is observed from the perspective of a third person. Playing hula game on a modified ""one"" engine, introducing some new patents and improving some old ones. As for technical issues, the graphics have been improved -. shadows, lighting, and textures are now better. Havok, on the other hand, is responsible for physics, thanks to which the elements of the environment are destructible and generally react to the actions of the player and other characters. After starting the struggle, we can choose only one difficulty level, which adjusts to our skills. If we are doing poorly and we die often, the enemies become less dangerous, and the number of medicines scattered around the corners increases. Of course, bullet time returns - the flagship attraction of the original. It allows you to slow down time, while giving the main character the ability to aim and shoot at a normal pace. Regarding the novelty, Max can now use two different weapons at the same time, melee (when close to the enemy) or fight alongside NPCs. Moreover, a new playable character appears. The player will direct the actions of Mona Sax during some levels. Completing the main storyline unlocks new difficulty levels and two bonus game modes, ie New York Minute and Dead Man Walking. The first one requires us to pass a given level as soon as possible, the second one tells us to face the incoming waves of enemies - addictive storyline - Bullet Time - lots of action - voice acting - comic cutscenes - graphics - soundtrack - sometimes sound, audio setting is poorly adapted to surround sound. - a short game ",1,0

"We are used to scolding and praising Call of Duty for the same things that we don't even want to list again. Millions of unassuming players by inertia bought new episodes of the series for the sake of another portion of Hollywood explosions and proven multiplayer over the years, and they, by and large, did not care about the lack of gameplay depth and a coherent, coherent plot. But even this cohort of players could not help but notice that Modern Warfare 3 was no longer making the proper impression. Apart from the destruction of Paris, there was not a single memorable scene in the game, and the multiplayer mode seemed to have lost some intangible biocurrents: formally everything was in place, but not everyone wanted to get lost in it for a week or two. Since the breakout in Modern Warfare, Black Ops has become the only game that has moved the series forward in any way, thanks in large part to the adventurous yet captivating horror story of the Cold War. For the first time, Call of Duty was not limited to a series of beautiful, but stupid scenes, but appeared as a coherent story-driven shooter, and some of the characters were even remembered in it. In turn, Black Ops 2 not only developed the ideas of the original, but brought them to a new level, forever (hopefully) shifting the emphasis of the entire series. Black Ops 2 was unexpectedly this year's revelation. No one expected fiction and plot delights from Call of Duty, but the result was one of the best adventure shooters in history: varied, atmospheric and surprisingly original. But! The next part is a must for the next generation of consoles. Treyarch are too talented people to be constrained by technical constraints. P.S. Stay tuned for our detailed story on multiplayer and zombie mode soon. ",1,0

"DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game. Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain is an over the top action third-person shooter. The title is a spin-off of the main Earth Defense Force (EDF) series. Similarly to the other titles, the game is very B-movie-esqe and revolves around shooting down giant aliens, bugs, and alien bugs. The series has a bit of a cult following and die hard fans.  -------- Comparatively to the other games in the series, Iron Rain actually has a smoother look. That doesn't mean the graphics are amazing, but they are a little nicer to look at than the more jagged and rough style of the previous titles. That being said, the graphic style of the previous titles might actually fit in that B-movie-esque theme more than Iron Rain.  The animations are still a little shoddy but for a game about defeating waves of giant aliens, it's more understandable that the trade off is some of the graphical power, as many creatures need to be on the screen at once. There is some variety in terms of enemies and locations, but most of it comes from the character customization, many different weapons, gear and particle/explosion effects on screen. Most, if not all the terrain is destructible as well.  -------- The game is almost fully voice-acted and although cheesy, it does lend to the theme of the title. The music is also a little cheesy but again, does fit in with the motif of the game; heavy adrenaline pumping themes and moral boosting music. The explosions and gun noises sound fine, although a lot of the background noise sounds the same. -------- The player runs around in third-person shooting down giant enemies with a huge variety of weapons and even tamed bug mounts. Yes, you can ride and fight with a giant scorpion or ant.  Two weapons can be taken into battle at once with a bunch of items. There are many combinations for different play styles, and this is a big strength of the title. After each stage, new weapons and upgrades can be unlocked and purchased with the various currency found throughout stages. The game is a very simple over the top shoot em' up, though there are many satisfying moments.    -------- Thanks to the developer for giving me the opportunity to review the title, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.

"This game is a really fun reimagining of Alice in Wonderland, it's actually a way better Tim Burton Alice than the actual Tim Burton Alice. It's gritty and edgy as hell, but the level design is fantastic and the music is amazing,  Don't play it if you have any psychological triggers though, as this game has TONS of asylum and mental illness imagery.

"It is said that ""second parts were never good."" Like every rule or saying, there are exceptions. And PAYDAY 2 is one of them. PAYDAY ""THE HEIST"" (the 1st) introduced a very innovative element to transform us into ""bad guys"" for once and make us like that. It was the first major bank robbery ""simulator"" and it did well, getting there roles on the robbery team, brilliantly introducing the element of stealth. And this dynamic, which so hooked many, has been brilliantly continued. Because PAYDAY 2 is 10 times more game than PAYDAY 1: 4 different skill trees, many more missions and more varied (further separated into phases), a lot of customization, a lot of weapons and a huge set of news about what its first part already provided . Climbing skills to be able to successfully overcome difficult levels will cost more than you might think, so it guarantees a huge number of hours of play, although you want to try to overcome the phases at their hardest level ""death wish"".

"Star Wars fans must buy the series. If you buy it, you will not be disappointed. The only game I am willing to buy on the orange root steam dual platform. Although the initial operation of the launch is disgusting for many people, the external forums are still under constant bombardment. The mechanism and gameplay were reworked and the 3-year update cycle was completed. A nine-part map and cooperation mode (caijin playing computer mode) Frontline 2 as a game released in 2017 has a cinematic quality experience and optimization, and it will still be at the top level in 2020. Disadvantages. The disadvantage of this game is that there is no server search function. You can only click to match. Sometimes when there is a room, he will automatically match you to a room with no one. At this stage, I don’t talk about ghost clothes but there are still few people.

"I don't review games as much, so long as the're getting their rightful praises and recognition. However, this game, no, this masterpiece has been so controversial, being called a walking simulator, a huge disappointment from kojima and so on, that I had to write a full review as soon as i finished it!  To begin with, i always expect the most out of kojima's work, following metal gear solid v: the phantom pain being a tremendous accomplishment even though it was never fully completed and had alot of missing parts, while just because it granted the player freedom, making it a masterpiece among pc games. Death stranding also grants the player freedom in a variety of ways, from controlling how they'll be getting from point A to point B to how many packages are you willing to challenge yourself to handle. I never seemed to feel the sense of repetition, as different deliveries required management of different terrains and the vast amount of devices and tools you'll be granted will never cease the excitement of heading out on a fresh new journey.  The game's graphics and optimisation is one of the few you'd see nowadays in new games, mostly they just want you to own top of the line hardware, on the other hand, kojima is like HELL NAW, everyone's getting a chance to play this game at 60 fps and definitely have same beautiful experience. The music is out of this world, and captures memorable moments strongly as you journey across america (fictional & based on Icelandic landscapes). The gameplay is surprisingly smooth, and i felt super comfortable with keyboard and mouse as my main controls, although the vehicles are somehow stuck to the ground and it's physics are terrible, but still manageable after getting used to, on the contrary it encourages walking, climbing and running through the amazing landscapes, or stealth through a mule's camp or terrorist occupied land, and only not missing on a single experience or to using roads. Roads which you'll be required to rebuild with materials & ofc. with the online social experience of players helping out, we repaired all roads leading around the map, makin' it easier for players to grind at a faster pace to complete achievements and connect america again Lastly, the story and OMFG it is a masterpiece, it's how i want next generation line of games to inspire to be. The innovation behind it is absolutely stunning, while konami took metal gear and turned into a zombie game that no one was interested in, kojima just straight up invented new type of paranormal monsters that will make you feel more intense and legit sometimes freaked out. I'm not gonna give out any details, as being curious and figuring stuff out as you play along is what sold the game for me.  So to summarise like every other person here on steam Positives: +++ story +++ ending  +++ graphics +++ music +++ Boss fights ++ gameplay Negatives: - vehicles - no option to play music as you free roam I've never thought i'd say this, but im glad silent hills was cancelled for this game. 9.5/10 - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kojima, you've done it again. Worth every penny i paid at full price! ",1,0

"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 6 years old when I heard my mom say to him, ""If you want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" I had never seen my grandfather cry before, he realized how much he had to lose if he continued to smoke. He threw the cigarette he was smoking on the floor and said he would never smoke again and tried very hard to keep that promise, unfortunately, three years later he died of lung cancer. It was very sad and it really destroyed me inside. My mother has since been telling me: '' Never smoke. Please don't let your family go through the same sadness that your grandfather put us through. '' I agreed and promised myself never to smoke. At 17, even after many temptations, I never touched a cigarette. I must admit that I deeply regret this, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

"I will say yes, the game is great as a ""filler"", i.e. when we play something and suddenly we get bored of it, we can turn on this game, it is best to play all the maps with our compatriots once and then some other game again. Overall, the gameplay is great as well as the game, but it couldn't be filled with disadvantages. So after around 30 maps, one and the game itself starts bugs. But it doesn't bother that much because it starts to get funnier (you become immortal, pieces of maps start disappearing etc.) But anyway, I highly recommend this game. ",1,0

The game is simply phenomenal and I can recommend it with a clear conscience even to people who are not avid fans of tactical stealth. Several dozen hours of great and not easy fun at the same time.

"It is definitely worth playing and above all to pass this game. It is true that it has certain bugs, crashes, etc. Basic problems that a game today should not have, but you know what? Nothing that cannot be solved. And beyond the technical and playable aspect, the point in favor of this great game is on the one hand its fantastic soundtrack and above all its great story. I just finished the game completely and it is honestly worth the experience of beating this game. Mysteries, existential dilemmas, murders, death, beautiful women, almost goddesses, inexorable destinies, are just some of the themes that you will find in this title. I must emphasize that the script of this game is simply sublime, it is one of those little predictable stories, in where the most remotely unimaginable happens, surprising you as you progress through the game. The plot of this game is almost like Poetry. Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut certainly leaves your mark as a gamer and a spectator. PS: I emphasize that possibly many of today's gamers find this game tedious and with almost primitive mechanics compared to other modern titles, however I encourage you to play this fantastic work, it really is a pleasant experience. A misunderstood gem. Hopefully one day they would release a remake of this classic. ",1,0

Where is the event? No Revelry? No moments of Triumph? I love Moment of Triumph, I look forward to buying my t-shirt. I love the designs you guys create for them. I love the seasons dont get me wrong, But you can add something better to them.  I know you guys are trying to repair what activision ruined,  But i feel like you are pushing away the core players.

We can clearly go back there for Outbreak, Dont delete the current tower  or the Farm. Just give up the old tower. There is no reason why we cant have more than two towers. Bring back the mountain. We can clearly go there on a cruicble map, but not as a public zone?! What happened to Factions?! A lot of people loved them. Vendors,              Give them more weapons and armor. Let it rotate every reset.  Bungie I love  you. You are doing your best, I get that. But you can do better if you listen to the player based.  Also, give me the emblem I paid for but never received.

Playing on simple human feelings and touching on well-known human problems, Bioshock unobtrusively weaves the player's thread of the plot, and the player's influence is so veiled that sometimes it becomes unclear whether you make this choice, or it is made for you. You can even say what Elizabeth actually chooses, and you act as her loyal bodyguard. When you first see her, you instantly feel sympathy for her. How can you keep such a lovely creature in a cage? Beautiful and innocent, smart beyond her years, with a thimble on her little finger, she seems to be an adornment of this fabulous world, which is called ""Columbia"". But, like everything human, this world is not at all perfect, as we will see in what follows. We play the role of Booker DeWitt, mired in his dark past, gambling and drinking, who lived an empty life until a stranger came to him one day and offered to pay off all his debts in exchange for a favor. “Bring the girl in and we’re calculated,” he said. And now Booker is sailing on a boat in the company of eccentric people, and in front of him is a lighthouse, the starting point of future events. As it turned out, everyone is dead at the lighthouse, which does not at all add confidence to Buker, but, gathering his courage, he nevertheless sits down in a strange chair, which suddenly seals himself and carries him ... no, not under water, but up into the clouds, so breathtaking! Before he had time to recover from amazement, a wonderful vision opens to his gaze, a city soaring in the clouds! Flickering and sparkling with sunbeams, city buildings sway smoothly, as if weightless, strange ships fly, people scurry below, and in the middle of all this splendor a statue of a certain prophet rises. After landing, Booker finds himself in the church and quickly realizes that it is better not to ask seemingly strange and stupid questions until he knows where he is. He is met by a priest, who will grant everyone access to the wondrous city if they repent of all their sins and accept the rite of baptism. There is some kind of celebration going on in the city, the wonders of science and technology are on display everywhere, careless citizens are having fun, dancing and laughing. However, Booker now and then stumbles upon strange posters that warn against a false prophet. Wandering in search of Elizabeth, Booker suddenly realizes that the false prophet everyone fears is him. An unsuccessful attempt to get into the building-statue, where the girl seems to be, turns out to be deplorable for him. The local law enforcement officers do not think to take him alive, and Elizabeth has to break through with a fight. An unexpectedly useful green liquid is an energy drink, which grants an extraordinary ability to hypnotize people and machines. Turning the course of the battle with her help, Booker quickly realizes that it is possible to move along the strange rails that entwine the city like a spider web. “A fire has already started in the city, I would like to find the girl and get out of here as soon as possible,” he thought. The prophet who has flown in from nowhere on an airship, clearly intending to carry out his prophecies, does not give him his senses. Booker only miraculously survived, and a miracle led him to the very place where Elizabeth was. This place was more like a prison, and there was something eerie and gloomy about it. Trying in vain to find Elizabeth here, Booker inadvertently steps, the floor beneath him collapses, and he falls so that he catches his breath from the blow, and his eyes grow cloudy. Scared blue eyes look down at him, Booker tries to move and nearly gets hit on his forehead by a hefty book. ""Elizabeth?"" - he asked. From this moment, their joint adventures in Colombia begin. Elizabeth will walk along with you her way of growing up, comprehend good and evil, joy and suffering, freedom and bondage. Traveling around Colombia, you will learn what secrets this city hides, how some suffocate and others breathe freely. You will discover what actions people are capable of for the sake of power, religion, money. You just need to carry a young and innocent heart through all this and make sure that all the dirt of heavenly Colombia does not touch it. Because the sky is also dirty and disgusting. As well as under water. Whether you will succeed in this, and where everything will lead, you can find out by passing this wonderful game. 10/10 ",1,0

"This is the second game I've played from this developer (I went in reverse order) and I am greatly satisfied with the experience. Growing up, I was taught in a strict school that focused on learning vast quantities (in my opinion) rather than deep understanding of a less content. As a result, my science background was never really developed as much as it could have been. After playing this game, I've come to the conclusion that this would have been a great way to teach young students on some very (very) basic concepts on a plant's growth. I'd imagine it would have been a worthwhile afternoon that would leave a longer-lasting impression compared to a mechanical way of doing things back at home (I lived in the SE Asian region). TL;DR: The game is very basic but it's a fun and impressionable medium. ",1,0

"Hi all !! ^^ Was so exciting to finally get that game, I really enjoyed the last light, and I heard everywhere it was even better (spolier, it wasn't) Just finished the game like...5 minutes ago, so it's still fresh, I apologize for my bad english at first, so Metro Exodus has many qualities that I gonna talk about, and few really bad sides, including one really bad... The game is GORGEOUS ! like really gorgeous, not just the textures, the shadow or the sunray, they really put efforts in design, details, and they improve faces models a lot ! But as everyone already know, you need like a PC from NASA if you want to get Max quality with good perf ( 60fps) it's not my case, so really, don't try to just get the most beautiful game you can, it's a fps, it has to be fluid, you can check my sett by checking my profil if you want, I was around 50-65 fps ( outside, and about 80-90 in buildings), with max resolution, ultra set, but nothing else...so be warned, the game is fat...After finished the game, I realise it wasn't really well optimizes... The story, a bit short, is sooooo catchy, every people you meet deserves a whole game ! You unfortunately don't cross stations like in previous Metro games, but chilling in the Aurora is just so cosy, feel really real, that's for sure ! Once again here is the bad side : The end...come really fast, no furthur explainations...kind of a shame, really :/ I had the good end, and didn't really feel like a good end, so that's to bad... So, here it was all about, just the two minors defects (you just have to find a good mix between perf and quality, and the end doesn't really matter next to the whole story, so, as Im good audience, I would have given like 17 or 18/20... BUT!!! here comes the crash... I seriously thought it was over, games coming out in 2019, crashing even more than a +200 modded skyrim, they all happen in the Caspien level for me, it seems I got lucky, cause that was all for me, but others players seem to have huge issues with others levels too...so honestly, it's a real SHAME, I managed to finsih the game, so Im not the most annoyed guy... I don't think any solutions will come out by producers, they're a lot off differents solutions on the net, or in the discussion of the game, but they don't work for everyone :/ SO finally...a real good game, everything was here to be a golden one...except producers giving a damn about clients, you're warned, you should give it a try, if you have a good sett, but take a look at all the problems first. Thanks if you read me, once again, sorry for the english :p enjoy after all !! ",1,0

It seems the developers and creators put a lot of effort into it within the resources they had available to use. I didn't mind the broken russian to english translation because it didn't prevent me from understanding the storyline. There isn't much dialouge in the game anyways so it was fine by me. There is a lot of exploring and gathering to be done in order to progress in the game. The ending depends on the paths you take during the game and its quite an emotional story. loved it. inexpensive, relatively easy to complete, and the sceneray is very nice. ",1,0

"(Before starting the review, I would like to refer to the store where I bought Turmoil for a few crowns: Nahodnyklic.cz). You can't expect anything from this game other than a relaxing game in which you extract oil and earn money, for which you can then buy upgrades or a percentage of shares. At the beginning you don't have to do practically anything, you just literally choose one of the four characters, choose the plot and just randomly try what he does and you slowly come to terms with it. However, I must disappoint you that this game is not that simple, because even on the lightest difficulty, the bots can turn around with you and the next step in terms of the map will be much harder (without spoilers). I also want to warn you that the game will entertain you only after a hard day as a break than any other action FPS game, and if Turmoil stops entertaining you after two locations, turn it off and do not push into the game unnecessarily, because the game can also stop you have fun completely and the 50 crowns I put into the game would be gone. If you want to finish the game you can say 100%, you must have 50% of the shares at the end of the game, so that you can go to a big island where there is plenty of oil (the icing on the cake). But the game doesn't have a story, just benefit as long as you can. I have to say that if you don't like to shoot Nazis after a hard and long day, this game is really for you. excellent 8.9 / 10 oil wells for me. + break as it should be + graphics + final island + idea * + gameplay + upgrades + actions * (idea) + time + music + font (classic western) + map + quite good artificial intelligence + background - story (missing, but due to you can forgive for a break) -after a while he stops having fun (rather I recommend Mr. blazek z wolfík) - after a while played: music, style of play (practically nothing new), graphics, ...-occasional drops FPS -if the game had more there would be more to offer, but as already mentioned, the game plays quickly and there is simply nothing more or nothing extra.

"I had this one on my wishlist for a minute. I bought it through Amazon and activated it here. Turns out I'm really enjoying this game. To the people that don't like the new Hidden Object/Adventure genre, you may not like this game. They don't really advertise it as a HOG on Amazon . I'm thrilled with it. I love HOG's,they were my favorite for a long time. About this game: Voice acting-very well done in my opinion and it saves people from reading,which keeps many people from playing games that are really great. . . Backgrounds- very pretty,looks like they took the time to actually get the scenes correct and nice to look at. . . Music- I usually turn down most game music most of the way,it tends to get annoying- I did the same with this,so can't really comment on it. Hidden Object scenes- were very nicely done. It's not the ""giant jumble pile"" a lot of games tend to use. The things in the scenes were relevant to the game and you really had to ""hunt"" for them. Puzzles- They became the same few puzzles over and over,but they were in places you'd expect them to be and they helped move on the game. . . For me,overall,I think I'd give this game an 8 out of 10,it was worth the price I paid (5 USD) but I don't think I'd pay full price (10 USD) for it personally,I think they try to charge way too much for HOG's that you will usually only play once anyway. Thanks for reading and Happy Gaming Everyone !! ",1,0

"How long have I been waiting for this DLS, since the very release I dreamed of a well-developed resistance system, otherwise it practically did not work in the vanilla game, so it was not clear why those bonuses for partisanship were needed, now it made sense. The system of the Spanish Civil War was really deeply deepened and made very interesting, probably even more interesting and richer in events than the main war. The game was quite rebalanced and this is noticeable, as promised, they reduced the number of divisions for the bots in exchange for teaching the AI ​​to close all gaps on the front line, from personal experience they really reduced the divisions, but the AI ​​is still the same, which is why I was capturing neighbors faster than usual, lol. Separately, it is worth mentioning the espionage system, which the vanilla game really lacked, made it quite deep, like a mini-game in a game, my eyes run up from the number of actions. The possibility of customizing the agency is also encouraging, but this is a role-playing element more suitable for multiplayer. In general, now the system of reconnaissance and coups has become much more logical, + the decryption system was transferred from technology to agents, freeing up space in the first, otherwise I remember complaints that it is impossible to have time to study everything, that it does not correspond to reality, etc. Well, now the Paradoxes have made life a little easier. This is the first time I've pre-ordered DLS in principle, and yet I haven't regretted it. We added those chips that I've been waiting for all these 4 years. They seemed to know what I want. ",1,0

"I played this game two or three years ago and it was a hard game as hell, there were many things that killed you with a HIT and you were very angry, the woods were more difficult, but you were still playing several and several times until zero . This game has changed a lot, there are not many things that kill you with a HIT, the woods are still difficult, you have a lot more classes to choose from, a lot more you do with really tough dungeons and now you have inventory to place items to increase defense, stamina, damage and stuff. I really enjoyed the game, I will play in all modes that are Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno, Agony and DESTRUCTION. the game has improved a lot since I changed a lot of new things, and I will definitely reset it again with other characters. In my opinion, if you are looking for a game with a high difficulty, buy that game. It may not have a good graphic, but what matters in this game is the gameplay and the fun of those who are playing. If you want to add me just send an invitation that I will accept :) ",1,0

The whole is handsome and cool. In terms of operation (keyboard + mouse players), I personally feel that there will be no difficulty in playing, and there are no too many and complicated keys, which can let people get started quickly. In terms of plot The plot is not bad, but there are still many things that have not been explained clearly, and I hope that a sequel will make up.

"I  posted this review together with 18 images   . When I wrote this review I'd spent approximately 4 to 5 hours playing the game,  but due to the level design  and  movement  issues (IMO), I found it difficult to progress.  It may be that you don't have the same issue as me.  I  failed to even complete the first few objectives, which are necessary to progress, i.e. collect a key and pull a lever.  I eventually found the key, then spent the next four + hours repeatedly dying and still haven't found the lever. On replaying it almost two years later, I've still not been able to get as far as the lever despite now having spent over 13 hours in bite sized bits playing.  I do think there are some issues that need work e.g. increasing the view area and  movement speeds. For now it's just too difficult for my slow reaction times to progress further.   RPG's are my favourite AAA genre (for example, over the last few years I've played the Elder Scrolls Online for over 8000 hours, and at least the same amount on other Elder Scrolls games such as Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim and an equal amount of time on the  later Fallout series (3, New Vegas,  4 and a little of the Fallout 76 online version).  I've been playing RPG's in various formats for almost 30 years; (my first one was called Darklands, which I bought on floppy discs back in 1992, then several years later,  Planescape Torment and Baldur's Gate),  and cannot ever remember struggling so much at the beginning of a game like I have with A.D.M (Angels,Demons And Men). This is not to say the game is  rubbish; in fact it seems like a decent unity  RPG .  I say this despite my lack of progress  because I'm sure it's my own lack of skill that is holding me back, plus I'm only playing it in  short sessions in between other  games. It's a challenging single player dark fantasy RPG with perma' death and  2D graphics in the  tradition of the old school cRPG's of the 1990's;  for example Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum: Of Steamwork's and Magick Obscura, and even the early Fallout games. However, I personally think the graphics are not quite  as good as those. That said,  graphics are not what makes a game in my opinion, so just take that comment with a pinch of salt. As with all RPG's you level up through experience and like most fantasy RPG's have access to a wide range of magical abilities and weapons, for example, Swift Blade, Bats Attack, Luminous Shield and Fireball to name just a few. After the  Smart Olive Games splash screen has completed, you are able to select from several language options that include English, German, Polish, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Japanese and Spanish. Once selected you have two game modes, but  the second one is locked initially. •	Story Mode •	Battlegrounds Unfortunately I've not  unlocked battlegrounds, but I will eventually update this review to include some information about the mode.  The story mode opens to a black screen with an intro' to the game (in really small type set), and  which is voiced by a female as follows: ",1,0

"The passage of the game for several main endings takes 10 hours, of which 5 hours you need to be touched by the cat girls, and the remaining 5 hours to grieve about the unfair structure of society, the futility of being and other problems of the universe. There are few choices in the game, but they are all significant, either in the near, or in the far, or even the ultra-long term, while there are a couple of dozen endings in the game, both differing in nuances and radically different. To my pleasant surprise, the initially annoying purple hamster moe-sidekick suddenly turned out to be one of the most elaborate characters in the history of Russian-speaking VN. I supported this project at the stage of crowdfunding and I am glad that everything ended successfully. ",1,0

"Where do I even begin with this review... I guess the first thing I need to suggest is that you gotta stay away from the anime adaptation. It was rushed and it messes with the story a lot. And if you already watched it, my advise is that you cool it down and try to forget all you saw there, and maybe give this VN a try in a couple of months, when you probably had forgotten about it (LOL). With that out of the way, I safely say this VN is one if not the best VN I have ever played. It's soundtrack is godlike, the story is really well written and the characters are really lovable. Some people might not like it since it's really grotesque at times (it's a Murder mystery VN after all), and sometimes the fanservice it's kind of in your face (Or at least ti was for me lmao), but if you handle those items, I can assure you are going to love this VN. On your first playthrough you are locked into the common route, but after that the endings are amazing (not saying that the common route isn't amazing tho). And don't get me started on the True end, it perfectly ties everything on the other endings and uncovers all the mysteries presented on the game, tho ngl I kinda wanted more after that. The gameplay is pretty straightfoward. Sometimes in the story you are going to get something called the Delusion Trigger, and your task is to choose between a positive or a negative delusion. On your first playthrough your choices won't matter much, but after that these will influence what ending you get. To wrap this review up, I totally recomend this VN for anyone who loves a good murder mystery. Doesn't help that this takes place on the same universe as Steins;Gate, and it also has a lot of references to it to it (and to Robotic;Notes). Oh, and I recomend applying the fanmade translation patch present on one of the Steam guides of the game. It makes the game more enjoyable! Give it a try! I'm sure you are going to ",1,0

"At the beginning, I would like to point out the buying advice for this game: If you are a personal fan of Dragon Knight 07, buy it! If you like the ""Sea Cat"" and ""Chilling"" series, buy! If you are interested in the plot and personality of the AVG game The demand is high, buy it! But if you can’t accept stomach medicine, scalpel, especially the kind of particularly beautiful young lady on the public screen, torturing you to the point where you don’t think about it...please...please think twice. First of all, I will give you a simple science. This game actually comes from a whole series created by Dragon Knight 07. This series is divided into the opening chapter ``Gao Hime'', the promotion of ``Song Hime'', in-depth ``Hen Hime'', and the core ``Deer God Hime'' "", and the final ""Wish Hime"". So this game is actually the last game in this entire series, and it is also the most classic, most prestigious and most popular work in this series. I don't know if ShiraVN will have plans to bring several previous titles to Steam one by one, but in terms of the operation of some previous games, it can only be said that it is not yet known. Therefore, before playing this game, if you have the opportunity, it is strongly recommended that players experience several previous games. The story of this work is closely related to the previous works. As the title says, it is a story about a millennium promised horror and moving. In the story, Ryo was saved by the gods at the cost of his life, but the black god made a wish, but there was no way to resurrect Ryo, so he had to make a wish that the love thousands of years ago could finally be perfect. Therefore, the story of a thousand years ago became a plot intertwined with reality, and finally it was perfectly condensed. Thanks to this, the coolness of a thousand years ago made a wish for a thousand years later, and I hope that the black god after a thousand years can obtain Happiness, in exchange for a summer of security for the male lead. The story of this work is actually very complicated, but the summary is also very simple, it is a reincarnation of salvation: the current man and woman saved each other thousands of years ago, and they were saved thousands of years ago, and they were able to save each other again. . It is complicated and touching here. It is the sorrow and vicissitudes of these millennia that have already reached the height of the plot. But objectively speaking, this work and even this series, all success stands here but also loses here. Such a complex plot setting is a highlight, but at the same time, due to the excessively large trend and the personal instability of Dragon Knight 07 himself in the long creative process, it has led to the same character in several works, There are also many unreasonable points in the plot trend. Moreover, the turbulence of the plot, and the structure of digging numerous pits but filling in these pits one by one, makes the plot impressive in some places, but it seems a little broken in some places. From this point of view, if you just look at the excellent work, and you only have a general understanding of the plot of the whole work before playing this work, you may be able to get the best experience. But if you have played a few previous titles, especially ""Guahime"" and ""Gehime"" (Dragon Knight 07's writing skills were still a bit immature at the time), you will inevitably have a lot of complaints about the whole plot. Apart from the above problems, in fact, this work can really be said to be a particularly outstanding work. This game has obvious characteristics of Dragon Knight 07 in the theme of Japanese style. The whole story is very long and the weight and quality are guaranteed. And the whole process does not bring those complicated branch options, so the brain is not tired, the plot The single part is delicate enough and the ending part is well-closed, and the whole age does not have H or is excessively bloody. So if you are tired of playing ""Sea Cat"" or ""Chilling"" series players can experience many, many different wonderful experiences in this game. On the other hand, the quality of this work is always guaranteed, because the price is really affordable, and the beautiful and beautiful OST and dubbing alone are enough, plus this series is late, so the picture is naturally more delicate and refined. . Dragon Knight 07 has tried commercial transformation before, but it is said that the final cooperation failed, indicating that he is really not suitable for a path similar to FGO. On the contrary, the unforgettable plot and personality of this work proves it. It is his fertile soil to practice art, literature, and write a good plot and story structure. Having said so much, in fact, in one sentence, even though the whole series of problems make this work have many flaws, but this game is undoubtedly a masterpiece of excellent content and quality.

"A game where you just glide through an automatically generated map The best part is how to make a thrilling gliding by getting a high score by flying on a narrow terrain.

In that case, it is recommended as it is, but I definitely want you to play with your favorite BGM. By doing so, it becomes the best sound game at once. If you can play in sync with the wind noise and your favorite music in a free sky with no course or enemies, your brain juice will be dripping. The game itself is very light, so it's good to let the pot cast run down, or create your own playlist. One song I personally recommend is Fatboy Slim's Sunset Bird of Prey.

"Pros: -Great gunplay (my favorite being the auto-shotgun).

Cons:  -Only melee weapon in the game (the meat tenderizer) feels odd and feels like it's weightless. -Music is hit or miss. Some tracks are good, others sound generic, and others just bad. -No health meter (The blood effect around the screen is utilized) along with no ammo counter for each gun. -Batteries to respawn weapons when you run of guns respawn infrequently. This results in going around in circles for a while to find one out of four of the necessary batteries to spawn something. -Enemy diversity is only on the surface level (they only look different and have no uniqe abilities). The cons really aren't that bad, as the game is still a blast to play. If killing sausages in your backyard with an uzi whilst sipping wine and listening to some funky fresh beats sounds fun, then buy this game now. This game deserves your attention. ",1,0

"Until today, I had to plow the wastelands of this game only once, at the beginning of the 2000s, so my choice was not dictated by fan urges, although there are nostalgic notes. However, nostalgia is easily destroyed, because the test of time has not been canceled. Time is a merciless thing. In order to gain immortality, you need to be a truly outstanding project, art with a capital letter, which is what it is. It is usually said that success is in simplicity; here it is exactly the opposite. The brainchild turns out to be an extremely difficult project in terms of implementation, because ... This applies to the main storyline, various secondary events, the gameplay itself and a great many little things. So that you understand the scale, now they do this: - unless with their own series - where everything is limited only by our imagination, and the developers themselves did not provide for some possibilities. The world of the game is strikingly different from the contemporaries of the series. Yes, this is still the same scorched post-apocalyptic wasteland, but the degree of cruelty and adulthood in general is elevated here to an absolute. If it were a thermometer, it would certainly explode. Before your eyes, the whole family will turn into minced meat under the fire of miniguns. The ""hero"" himself may turn out to be a b *** com without moral principles, who easily deals with children, there is even a feature that is permanently attached to the hero:. Playing a female character, you can act out, which can solve many of her problems through bed, and if this is not enough, you can become - this is by the way a perk, i.e. the usual ability that is given every 3 (4) level ... In addition, if the game was released today, the LGBT community would be in a pleasant shock, because everything that is required is present in the game, the main thing is not to delve deeply into the materiel, so that awkward questions in the spirit do not arise : Ahem. Although the combat system may seem clumsy, besides, there are no fashionable shelters nowadays, however, there are, for example, critical blunders that negatively affect the one who actually missed: misfires, various injuries, falls, etc. It comes down to the comical - a lot depends on the points invested in ""Luck"". In addition, do not forget that the local, turn-based combat is equipped with a system of aiming at various parts of the body, which means that you can hit the ""balls"" with a particularly sticky pepper, or finally check if the Super Mutants have something there ... Character creation here is a very important, very intimate step that needs to be approached very thoughtfully. Moreover, I will not say hackneyed: (a set of skills, statistics). : - since in these vast expanses, your character's success depends on a set of skills and statistics. Even an ardent loser with one (out of 10) luck has a right to exist, moreover, it has a number of its advantages, but it is you who must decide and understand that your hero will be a loser in life. And who said that the main character's failure should not be passed on to others as well? Or maybe you want to play as a complete slow-witted? Always playing a thief? Well, here you can fully get used to the skin of it, because Everyone has pockets and anything can be found in them, besides, experience points are awarded for a successful theft. Class! The threshold of entry is quite biting, which is facilitated by the interface, partly game mechanics and not the most expressive beginning. However, it is worth getting used to, leaving a little later, where the eyes are looking and opens before the player, the implementation of which by the player often will not remain without consequences. Did you want to try yourself in the slave trade? You are welcome! But know that you are branded with a seal on your forehead. Have you decided to destroy one of the most dangerous bandits? His embittered brothers have already advanced behind you. Is the nimble prankster who still has milk on his lips robbing a gaping hero is not the first time? - for no apparent reason, a naturally detonated child sprinkled the unreliable quarter with his entrails. The most interesting thing is that in the local open spaces there is no clear division into typical components: research, battle, completing tasks. The line here is extremely blurred and any microscopic event can result in anything, for example, promiscuous sexual intercourse can lead you to the altar at gunpoint ... ",1,0

"I got this product for free on the incentive. I bought the game in the gazebo, tied the account to the stim and gave it. Overall, I liked the game. Well, I'm not going to praise either, because there are enough shortcomings. ADVANTAGES. The game is very similar to Fallout 4 (only Fallout 76 is worse). More than any different weapons and modifications for weapons and armor. Pleased with the dialogues. They are not so monotonous and I liked the factor that again appeared in the dialogues ""Strength, endurance, charisma, intelligence"" (well, I think you understand who played NV and part 3). Well, I didn't remember the tasks themselves, which means they were boring and typical (but there are a couple of interesting ones). The community is friendly. I've met some bugs and won't say that they are so critical. I liked the world itself (here people do not eat their bread for nothing). LIMITATIONS. Terrible optimization. What kind of optimization is there? She's not even there. There is no balance (well, I run at level 39 and I come across ghouls, super mutants and other evil spirits of level 69. Is this okay? Well, I understand if 42-45, but 69 is just a shock) Well, how can OUR GREAT AND LOVED TODD HOWARD NOT DONATE? HE IS FASTING. I apologize for the mate, but the bitch in whose stupid head came the idea of ​​introducing donat into paid games? What the fuck am I supposed to pay for a game like that and for a single company?

"Souls in 2D. And I could stop there. Apart from the camera, probably no game is as close to From Software's production as this one. The differences are small and you can say that where the developers wanted to differentiate a bit, it was worse - like a development tree, which is huge, but the distribution of skills there is bizarre (by targeting the rogue, I wanted to develop more damage dexterity, and to use better knives, I had to raise mainly stamina). Restricting access to NPCs by figures and only a few slots per temple was annoying. And the bosses, although they look good and they differ, the fights are similar - here I was suffering from the lack of the third dimension. For example, we could add a second or third plan and jump between them, it could be interesting. ... but I won't just complain. I had almost as much fun as with the DS series. The same feeling when you defeat some more difficult enemy or finally find a place to rest. Map and various shortcuts to other places. And this climate in general. Backed up by a great soundtrack and small things like different kinds of ""estuses"" depending on where we got them from. The game is addictive and you want to come back to it, and this is the most important thing. A must-see for Soulslike fans. ",1,0

He knew so much from his experiences taking down a dark secret corporation that kills his wife and child and to being seduced by Sexy Mona ( who can pull machine guns out of her panties) lol wtf. With stories this far fetched its hard not to burst out lauging at how serious this game takes itself. But it translates so well!!! Y?! Because he is Max Bleeping Payne. This is a character that has been built up from his failiures but is too ignorant to realize it. His mind is clouded by his addiction to Rhino Whiskey and Vicodin painkillers, which makes him repeat the same mistakes he made in the previous games. He's a good guy but he beats himself up and sabotages his friendships so that he can wallow in the self pity that kept him sane and alive for 30 more years. But why sane and alive? Well Max always knew he deserved a painfully slow death for all the women he allowed to die in the previous games, Or he thought he did, but as usual with these types of people, time comes by to slap them and give them a hickie. And a product of time was his good friend Raul Passos who over time develops a bromance with Max as they work security details in Panama and Brazil (lol jk, they dont do it guys :) . Max awakens and his desire to persevere and push on another day becomes a natural instinct for him as he faces enemies from all sides threatning to kill the family he is protecting :( . ♥♥♥♥ goes baha from there and the place becomes Baghdad on G-strings.

"The game was literally in one breath, everything in 2 hours and it took me only 6 hours to complete the game. This is a penny in comparison with the fact that I spent much more hours in games with a closed world. By the way, all games from the Saints Row series have an open world. I really don't know what to say about the game .... Of course it is better to go through it with a friend, it will be both fun and cool and have an interesting time. The game has no intricate plot, a lot of guns, and most importantly, a lot of humor. There are only 5 sections of Hades in the game, where you will have to help all the villains from the past games in order to remove Satan from the throne together. There are also 7 secret weapons in the game, which, when pumped to the maximum, will blow up, break everyone and everything. New characters have appeared and during the game you can play as Johnny Get or Kinzi. The game takes place in Hell, so the enemies are mostly devils or souls of dead people. This game is worth playing for the sake of trash, guns, Satan and unforgettable sensations, by the way, there is no God in this game))))) ",1,0

"Great Action FPS Open World RPG game! Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games and got me very hooked. With a story that contains jokes (Some are funny) You can customize the character as you want. There will be 4 characters to choose from, if 2 more DLC will be added, each of which has a different gameplay perspective, fast, easy-to-understand gameplay and not too poor, even if the AI ​​is not very smart, but if it's smart. I think this game is going to be very difficult because I see each parade in the army -..- Importantly, you can co-op with up to 4 friends!!! There is a lot to do in this game. With an open world where you can find guns, level up, do sub-quests to get more items. Good things are not so difficult to find. Even though playing alone is a little boring. Other advantages - The music matches the situation well. - This game is falling from a high place, it doesn't hurt hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Plus enticing It is another charm. If you've never played FPS games before, try Borderlands 2.If you really like leveling up, you'll be sucked into this game and don't have time to do anything else. (Bundle) ",1,0

"Well, I say again as in the review for season 1, this game is not worth $ 15, passed it in 10 hours, although I had the opportunity to pass faster, there were just cases that went somewhere and the game did not turn off and time went by. And so I want to say that season 2 is much better than 1, in principle, much less boring parts in the episodes, but again it was furious that you are always forced to do it all, despite the fact that here is a little girl 11 years old, doing some things like an older person should do it. At certain moments, the choice of events is interesting. Well, damn really, why do they make such a short game, for $ 15 if the sequel lasted at least 30 hours, I would have bought it maybe without a discount, although it is quite expensive at our rate. And so the game is worth everyone's attention, it is interesting, this style of play is not for everyone, but you can get used to, all on the cap of Clementine and one severed hand Lee p.s. (Buy me a game Walking Dead: New Frontier, i do not have money xD) ",1,0
"TL;DR - it's an incredibly fun game where you're one little dude fighting in large battles. The game lets you play pretty much any way you want, whether it be taking part in the intense frontline action, or sneaking behind the enemy and taking them out with silenced weapons. Very fun, highly recommended if you like the idea! Oh and there's multiplayer. In RUNNING WITH RIFLES (RWR) you get dropped into the middle of a brutal and bloody war between the Greenbelts (USA), the Graycollars (Germany), and the Brownpants (Russia). You play as one soldier in an army of hundreds as you slaughter dozens of enemy soldiers, die a lot, get reincarnated each time as another soldier, and rise gradually through the ranks, battling it out across some unknown country trying to completely dominate the enemy. RWR is super fun, and the developers are friendly and dedicated to the game. There is a campaign mode, where you go from one map to the next, completely capturing each one as you go,   There are about 10 maps (which are all very well designed) to wage war across in the campaign. You can also play any of these maps as a single quick battle, although there's no guarantee that it will be over quickly. Each map can take anywhere from 20 minutes to over 5 hours   with the frontline moving back and forth with each attack and counter-attack. In multiplayer, you can play PvE or PvPvE, with a huge number of people (up to 64 I believe). Playing online is super fun because you can actually use proper teamwork with other players, to annihilate the enemy soldiers on the front lines or to stealthily capture a base behind the enemy lines. When you start playing, the basics are obvious: run with your rifle and click in the direction of enemies to shoot at them. But it's not actually that simple, because the game is fairly realistic when it comes to dying. One bullet is enough to drop you where you stand, leaving you wondering where the bullet even came from. Running straight towards the enemy holding down the left mouse button will get you killed over and over with no reward. You have to use cover, utilise mortar and artillery strikes, call in airborne reinforcements, move with your allies, set up machine gun installations, and use tanks or other vehicles to break through enemy lines. There are lots of different weapons and items that you can use, including shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, riot shields, and flares. There is something for pretty much every playstyle. Need to get behind the enemy and destroy a comms tower? Get in a camouflage suit, take a silenced sniper rifle and pistol, some C4, and you're good to go. The game lets you change quite a few game options before you start a singleplayer game, such as friendly/enemy accuracy, starting XP and RP, etc. This basically determines the difficulty. On higher difficulties, the game is very tough, and this is when battles become hour-long stalemates, the streets and fields quickly turning into blood-soaked killing grounds, until you successfully create an advantage by changing up your tactics. Overall, if you like the idea of being an individual taking part in a large-scale war, you should definitely put this game on your wishlist. Keep in mind that you will die a lot, and it can be kind of frustrating at times, but it's always entertaining. It's also obvious that a lot of love was put into the game. Overall, just really good. Highly recommended! ",1,0

"More than a game, it is a visual and sound experience, since it does not represent any more challenge to keep moving forward. The puzzles are extremely simple and nothing can kill you. The achievements can all be easily obtained by going around a lot to catch all the crap. I have played it with 3D glasses which has struck me a lot, (I have used a mod to improve the 3D effect), with glasses the feeling of diving and the depth is amazing, the fish around you ... great, but in 2D things change a lot. It lasted just 2h and wasting time fiddling with the 3D, going around to catch things, show it to my brother doing the chorra ... come on, I think you can finish it up to 1h I recommend it because it seemed unique to me in Its genre and the 3D effect is impressive, but at the price I would not buy it.

"Hello, I bought Umav ARK with my friend excitedly on the first day of the game and the game was so tight that I didn't like it, but the game was great, it just wasn't played until the middle of this year ... I downloaded it this year and tried it, I saw that the optimization problem of the game still does not end. There is no sign of bugs, lags, problems, 3 fps was a game I got 30 fps I took the opportunity and started to play with a harb, Arab was playing so stupid that I cannot tell then he invited me to a tribe (clans tribes in the game) and I had very good friends. You can necessarily meet friends with enemies. You will not notice how the time passes from the excitement of the game and how you shout in the raids (blowing up the house of the guys). I bought the game for 40 TL, if you find a discount, I say don't miss it. GAMEPLAY INFOS 1. I wrote above, the enemies never disappear if you are playing on a pvp server, do not fight before they develop, do not attack the empty animals here, if there is no man on it and it is not next to your basin. 2. Make a bola immediately and a Wooden Club (knocked stick wood club turkish, but I don't know how they translated it) take a pte immediately, it does not matter the level, your first bird is ultimately and knock it out with a stick! (if you want to do it, kill the turtle and dig with an ax) 3. Your home is hidden, make a small place, develop turrets and bullets there, then you will be set up in 1 hour 4. Do not use the Chat Box, you do not get anything when you write the mourning. and be understanding and make friends;) ",1,1

"Since this game has been ripped apart right from the start, yet I consider myself among the very few who really enjoyed playing it, I want to leave my feedback. I wouldn`t call it a review, because in my opinion this expression should always have a touch of objectivity... However, after playing it through for two times and getting 100% achievements I think I have seen enough to be able to leave a remark. In short, and leaving all technical troubles you might face aside, you need to ask yourself, whether you like the shooting/ stealth mechanics this game has to offer, or not? And, because this game consists of millions of shoot-outs who play out very similar it stands or falls with liking that or not. The good thing about it is that you can easily find this out within the 2 hours refund range Steam offers. If you have played the first ""Watch Dogs"" you will directly feel familiar with handling those bad guys and this means, if you stay in control of the situation and patiently sneak through the enemy ranks it is relatively easy to survive. Should you be seen or using unsilenced weapons, however, the situation can quickly turn and enemy reinforcements can overwhelm you. For me the gunplay and stealth mechanics feel very satisfying (what a morbid thing to say given the brutal nature of those encounters) which actually didn`t let them get boring for me.  So, from an open world game like this I expect ""driving and shooting"", and when the game delivers exactly this is it valid to call it repetitive? You wouldn`t play the ""Middle-Earth"" games, if you don`t like to hunt down thousands of Orcs, often in exactly the same way, right?  I love how the game is presented, showing cut-scenes about every major character. You annoy the bad guys, often this will result in a cinematic depicting their mood after you did this. To me this felt very satisfying… and fresh. Maybe the game would have had a better chance, if it wasn`t called ""Mafia""? Playing a colored Vietnam Veteran on a vendetta maybe has a more ""Rambo 1,5"" vibe to it? However, I personally couldn`t care less about the name, and since most people compare the game to ""Mafia 2""… For me that one was the emptiest open-world game of all times, filled with Mafia clichés and a main character that is rising within the family just to keep doing the work of Henchman #9.  I think Vito has much more personality in ""Mafia III"" than before, so he gets a thumbs-up from me for his guest performance. I find the history behind everything in this game quite interesting and equally tragic, and after a gaming session I caught myself googling for many subjects I met in-game. Mardi Gras, Papa Doc, Dixie Mafia...  And then, of course, being colored in the United States of the 60`s…  Is there any other non-RPG game where a shop owner threatens you with the police just because you want to buy a beer? Kudos to the game developers that they have taken this route. I found the characters and overall atmosphere very fresh. Again, I don`t care a lot, if the game runs with 30 fps or 1000 fps, if many of the buildings are copy and pasted models …or that there are completely dark areas whereas you don`t have a flashlight… (what???). I found the whole mix of the used ingredients entertaining, captivating… but also touching. Oh, and on a side note: Once you (according to most people) tortured yourself through the game, don`t skip the credits at once.  There`s yet another cut-scene which might be able to put a satisfying grin to your face… What? This cut-scene is capped at 29,97 fps and not in 16K??? Burn it, burn it!!! Bring torches and pitchforks! ",1,0

So far the game has been really refreshing and not as repetitive as other platformers I have played.

"So after playing a while I think it's time to give this game the review it diserves. To be honest I had much trouble getting this game running. At the beginning I got lots of VAC-Bans which made playing less fun. But I figured out that my firewall is making problems so I fixed it by setting it of while playing. So for everyone who wants to buy this: Be aware there could be trouble with software on your PC that gets in conflict with valves VAC.  Here's a list with programs may conflict with steam:   I have CCleaner, AVAST and TUNEUp installed and no problems with that. I think that steam is reacting different on any system. I am very caught by the gameplay even when you have to deal with some really BAAAAD defeats xD but honestly the gameplay is fair...most of the time. Yea they might have problems with hackers sometimes, but mostly players get rid of them very soon by reporting them. Ranking system is very fair. I ranked much faster than I expectet. Weapon choice if fair and even beginners will not have unfair conditions when playing with high ranked players except for the skill, but thats what you have everywhere.  So all in all its a nice game to waste time with. When you wonna learn russia in a 4 week crash course and enjoy having a good time with friends, definitly worth it. ",1,0

"When I chose the samurai! 1.) The path of the samurai is found in death. 2.) Always be helpful to your master. 3.) Our body receives life from emptiness. 4.) Remember the filial duty to your parents. 5.) A warrior must prepare for everything in advance. 6.) Inside - the skin of a dog; outside - the skin of a tiger. 7.) Imitation of other people's traditions is indulgence. 8.) Show great compassion and help people. 9.) Don't let others get ahead of you in the samurai path. 10.) A flawless person is one who gets away from vanity. 11.) A warrior should never be hesitant. 12.) A samurai without a clan and without a horse is not a samurai at all. 13.) The path is something more sublime than righteousness. 14.) Everything in this world is just a puppet show. 15.) I don't know how to defeat others; I know how to conquer myself. 16.) Someone who knows very little will pretend to be an expert. 17.) In times of danger or anxiety, one word decides the case. 18.) Improve your mind, be human and be bold. 19.) Truly there is nothing but the real purpose of the present moment. 20.) The one who treats the world like a dream does the right thing. 21.) If you understand one thing, eight others will also be revealed to you. 22.) If everything in the world is nothing more than pretense, only death is sincere. 23.) It is very important to express your opinions to people and correct their mistakes. 24.) Since death is always near, you need to make an effort and act without delay. 25.) Before expressing your opinion to a person, consider whether he is able to accept it. 26.) A samurai should avoid a lot of sake, excessive pride, and great luxury. 27.) It is not easy to give up silly thoughts and cultivate genuine impersonal thinking. 28.) Feigned laughter betrays a man's lack of self-respect, and a woman's lust. 29.) When there are two ways to choose, there is only one quick and only way out - death. 30.) If you start reasoning on the battlefield, there will be no end to this reasoning. After reading a book or scroll, it is best to burn it or throw it away. 31.) There are rules for raising a child in a samurai family. From infancy, courage should be encouraged in him, never teased or intimidated. 32.) If, strengthening his heart with determination every morning and every evening, a person can live as if his body had already died, the path will be free for him. 33.) There are two things that can mislead a servant: wealth and fame. If the servant is constantly in need, he will be perfect. 34.) When a master says something pleasant or unpleasant to you, and you listen to him without saying a word, he may think that you are confused. Therefore, it is important to give him the correct answer. 35.) Since we often rely on our own discernment, we easily become greedy, do not listen to the voice of reason, and then events do not take the best turn. 36.) No matter how you say it, formally or informally, always look the listener in the eye. The polite greeting should be said once, at the beginning of the conversation, and not repeated. It is impolite to speak with downcast eyes. Loyalty to the master was also expressed in pointing out to him that his decisions were wrong. But with all this, the samurai was obliged to carry out the order of his master in any case, even if he could not convince him to cancel the unjust decision. This is the kind of samurai I will become ",1,0

But I trust the Communist Party so much, why should I betray me again and again, but in fact, the underground party can end after the founding of the country. Is Xiao Tu so good? Not necessarily. After all, Xiao Tu is just a character living in the novel. So if the real me asked me to choose once, I would rather he died under the gun of the Japanese during the War of Resistance against Japan and become the victim of national justice. He didn't want him to survive the ten years of the Cultural Revolution and face the spurn of his compatriots all day long. Since greatness and insignificance are relative, who can't be the great insignificance? So even if I understand that ""Zhou Gong feared the day of rumors, Wang Mang was courteous and not ushered. Xiangshi died in the first place. Who knows the truthfulness of his life?"" I will still choose this way. Because I understand better that history has always been written by victors. I want to say it again... this game is really great! And the young ladies in it are also very good-looking, I love it. ",1,0

"This work has changed so much that it is different from the previous work because the engine has changed to UE4! This is a comparison from β, but the operation has become considerably lighter due to the update. (Although it is still heavy ...) In my environment, if you lower the setting, the average is about 100 FPS. (i7-3770k 16GB GTX970) It's not as beautiful as BFV, but the expression of light is at a level that makes me think ""Oh, it's beautiful ...""! It hasn't been completely optimized yet. So I'm looking forward to future updates ~ As for the sound, I can hear a lot of footsteps. Also, the gunshots and bombing sounds are terrifyingly powerful! To be honest, I think the sound is top-level and beautiful. As others have said, this is much more casual than the previous one. This work is still for hardcore, but I think it's easier overall, such as knowing the approximate number of bullets in the magazine when reloading. There are pros and cons to this, but I personally think it is. Many of the systems have been inherited from the previous work. However, ammunition can be replenished at each point, and bombs can be installed even if you do not have thrown objects or RPGs when destroying the base, so this has also become casual. Also, AI has become much smarter and more human. It is common to take the back, shoot hard, and shoot through a wall. Therefore, long-time potatoes are also prohibited lol From the above, I think that the previous work had a majority of single-shot potatoes, but it has changed to a fully automatic, always-moving move without worrying about the number of bullets. Regarding MOD (workshop), it is not supported at the time of writing this review (12/17). Since the previous work had a lot of mods, I would like this work to be supported as well ... This is also expected in the future ~ I wrote only good things, but of course there are many problems ... (´ ・ ω ・ `) First of all, loading is slow! It is no exaggeration to say that this game requires SSD. It's slow to load. It's not so fatal in play, but you may not see your body, attachments or guns. And matching is unexpectedly slow! The population is decent, and with PVE it is about 8 people, but auto matching is slow. So, like the previous work, you may want to choose your own server. I've written this for a long time, but if you're worried about buying this game, buy it and fight together as a member of the squadron !!! ",1,0
"The game in which absolutely everything is really worked out! Dialogues, a huge number of additional tasks / places, the atmosphere, which is conveyed by excellent graphics and sounds.

Orwell meets Bioshock in this story driven stealth game with light RPG and crafting mechanics. The game succeeds in world building through environmental lore and a rich story back by splendid voice acting.  The game does however have a few issues with minor graphical bugs such as people sitting inside chairs and floating bottles and of course the ever present ragdoll corpse giggling we have come to know in games. Overall this is an excellent game well worth your time to check out. 8.5/10 ,1,0

"Yes, this game is an extremely simplified TBS but hear me out first. If you, like me, have other real life obligations and can't stomach starting a game that you know will take 40-60 hours to complete, then maybe this is for you. Lately, I've been enjoying more and more games that are easy to pick up and put down. This is one of those. I'm a fan of the XCOM series, but as I said earlier, it's too difficult for me to start playing a game I know will take a huge time investment. If that's the case for you as well, then this is a solid choice. Especially if now, time is more valuable to you than money. ",1,0
"The story of the game is good (sometimes silly but it keeps you entertained.) I think the developers put a lot of work into the game. The maps are detailed and the graphics are really nice. I did not really like the way stealth mechanism worked in the game (It was really difficult not to get caught by some guard all the time, and once they noticed you it was difficult not to get engaged in a fight with everyone.) I did not like the way maps were 'cut up' to smaller sections (I wish there would be bigger maps the player could explore... Like in the previous games.) The player can't choose weapons or other equipment before starting a mission.The game has a console port feel to it (push 'q' button repeatedly to choke out someone.) Overall not a bad game but they mainstreamed it for wider audiences. 72/100 ",1,0
"""-It's me cl4p-tp my name is ... -TA GUEULE! -Okaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" Hello finally I mean people! Today we find ourselves after 17 years and 35 days of radio silence in a new evaluation (humoristic?). Well, we're not going to take ♥♥♥♥♥♥ let's start. First of all Borderland (just the game) was developed by Gearbox, it seems to me that it's just a detail. The game itself is a fps (seen first person) with a lot of weapons (it's a detail) but above all full of humor, dlc (lel), classes ... The game itself is also and there this is the moment that we are all waiting ... AN RPG yes an rpg so good it is not very fallout but we find the exp the skill pts to pay in the trumps the weapons overs cheat which requires 44 levels of more than you and the enemies who shoot you with 3 more level (yes yes I'm not kidding) In short the main quest is very stupid to kill the ""bô jack"". So that's what it seems to me afterwards with the dlcs you're going to have lots of new missions full of hours of play and more For a successful game playing alone is boring, suck, we piss off. But Gearbox has it all covered! You can play up to 4 Players to go kill bad guys (cool isn't it) so good to avoid playing with friends with 45 more levels than you because you will be pissed off (true story) but go start an adventure together in joy and good humor! ♥ In terms of textures well I can't put it to the max (thank you, I love my life I know it) but otherwise on the graphic side it is far from disgusting it's just a matter of taste (I don't remember how we call the textures which looks like comics) after CONFIG / GRAPHICS level it is far from being a joke (Nannnnnnnn, well I hope not but hey look for yourself for 30 € you will have -a duration decent life -a gameplay where you will laugh -a cute game (antiphrase) -and above all A robot that will break your balls during the adventure (claptrap ♥♥♥) If you liked this evaluation, do not hesitate to put a thumb towards god if not put it towards nothing. If you laughed or a little smile put that this evaluation is funny (because it is a little the goal and it allows me to know if I have humor or if I am rejected as cl4p-tp). Put a comment on my profile then it would please me ♥ kisses and adopt a cat ♥ ",1,0

"If you come from games related to the MOBA type League of Legends or DOTA 2, this game presents you with a new type of environment in your daily life, giving you to understand that a third-person game of the same genre can be entertaining, however, you are not going to manage to replace the experience that other games give you. In short, it is like all MOBAs, but for people with more congenital diseases. In the same way, it is a game that if I had more time, if I would dedicate my days to addiction, it is still a competitive game after all, which is what all those who are integrating into the world of online competitiveness seek . It provides a nice gaming experience, fluidity and a fresh environment that we are used to. An 8.5 score game to my liking. ",1,0

"I love Retro Futuristics and XCOM, and this game contains, that's all)) of the pros: - good visual design (A la Posters for movies 50-70xx) - the music is also good, it directly creates the atmosphere of those films (right now such films no one does ...) - combining equipment in Ulta for the Hero (there is no such thing for the Aliens) - the ability to infect and disguise as Aliens (answer to Ulta Heroes) - there is a Morale parameter (only for Heroes), which affects the correctness of decision making , i.e., if you find Aliens (and even more so killing them) or help your team, you will receive Heroism, which accumulates your Ult, but only you fail (for example: killing an innocent), then you will receive Demoralization, which imposes Negative and removes Ulta to zero - the cost of the game from the minuses: - few maps and modes - minor bugs, like: - does not find the game session (it helps, only restarting the game); - the game freezes, if someone is thrown out during the game and when this player wants to return to this session, then the player is connected endlessly - not very smart AI for BOTS I put this game 8.75 Infections out of 10 !!

"I don't understand the negative reviews. The CEO, Swen himself, clearly stated if you don't want to experience this game in Early Access with bugs and all, do not purchase it. The early access has about 1/10th of the content that is going to be available on release. There are optimization issues, buggy cutscenes, etc. I haven't bought a full priced game in many years, but this was a no brainer for me. Divinity Original Sin 2 was my favorite game of all time, and if you enjoyed that game than you will love this. The combat system varies in that it has gone towards a traditional 5e DND style instead of what DOS2 was. The leveling system seems to have been condensed, but I'm only 4 hours in, so its too early to tell. This is the first character creation I actually enjoyed. The character models alone are unlike anything I've ever seen. It's clear the amount of work they put into every customizable feature. The visuals and cutscenes blew me away, and once all the kinks are worked out it will be even more enjoyable. I love the story so far, but once again I've barely started. If you are on the fence, just wait. There is no rush to buy this game. It was released primarily for the people who have been waiting so long for it just to get a taste and be early supporters to make the game into what it will be in the coming months. I wouldn't base your decision on reviews with less than 20 hours, outside of game breaking issues. And those reviews won't be out for at least a week. Personally, I was a bit put off by the price point of $60 versus $45 for DOS2, but after seeing the sheer quantity of fights, interactions, and content available between the two in Early Access, the extra $15 is more than justified.

"Well, back in 2017 when the anime debuted, watching it was what got me into the Science Adventures saga, even though I had a little time with Steins; Gate, and listening to Itou Kanako sing Nitro + / MAGES anime openings. / 5bp, but Chaos; Child made me enter this world, and soon I was completing Chaos; Head, in order to understand everything correctly. Well, two years have passed since then, and I finally had access to this work of art that left me even more impressed with the series. Chaos; Child is simply a masterpiece, which impresses you from start to finish, with unpredictable plot twists, and explores several human areas perfectly, in the sense of passing what you want and selling your fish. With a great soundtrack that made me cry at the end of the game, very good graphics, quality waifus, and well explored. Even though some characters pass vague, each has its importance for the impact of the story, which is much more than young people with superpowers and murder mysteries. Anyway, I recommend this masterpiece, even if you’ve already watched the anime, even if you read it already knowing things, it’s a completely different experience, worth the time. And yes, it is very good that Chaos has been read; Head, to understand everything, as well as having read Steins; Gates, to get the references, in fact, despite the works of the Science Adventures Series, they are very distinct, they are all interconnected. I can only be thankful for being able to read this, my sastification is huge, just for completing the first ending. ",1,0

"Hello, welcome to my Mirror's Edge ™ review Let's start with small details Developer: EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) / Game engine: Unreal Engine 3 Release date: January 13, 2009 PC version Gameplay fps the main character named Faith in the main story (from a first person perspective) We are controlling the foundations of the game, jumping from buildings to buildings, conflict, things like this. It has attracted a lot of attention among game genres. The aim of the game and what glorifies the game is the parkour feeling from the fps perspective. This feeling is good for this game, however you say, but if you played dying light before playing this game, then this game melts in your eyes. Graphics The graphics of the game are good compared to a game released on January 13, 2009. In the game, in general, the tones close to white were used too much. Most of the places are white. Scoring 8 out of 20 in terms of gameplay 7 out of 20 in terms of graphics 7 out of 20 in terms of artificial intelligence etc. . Please do not copy my review. ",1,0

"I really enjoyed it. You play the son of a killed fighter. Not even being able to find money to buy food at the beginning of the game, etc. the challenges are beautifully designed. Over time, you become a famous fighter and find your father's killer. I think the game can be completed in 6-7 hours even by doing every side task. In the process, there are many references to cult characters, ranging from nice jokes to ninja turtles to MK characters or to Fallout's power armor. It is clear from all that it is a work created by people playing games. Since there are two different ways in the script, you may want to consider finishing a second time. In this sense, you can think of it as 6-7 hoursx2. In summary, it has an average lifespan, fun in general terms (if we do not count the correct status afterwards) and a catchy structure. ",1,0

"I'm not sure you should try and directly compare this to the original, i think that's a bit unfair. You see where they have taken the old xcom ideas and touched it up with new ideas and features that do work well. No more 5 our terror missions was a nice relief. No base attacks either but i think i can accept that. Overall its a very nice re-imagining/reboot whatever you want to call it that you should not compare directly with the original. Accept it for what it is, and that is a new take on the XCOM I.P sourcing from how it used to be and updated and tweaked to suit the modern audience. Blows away all the other Xcom style games, that have come out over the past 8 years. Id recommend any veteran player of Xcom to go straight to classic mode, the true difficulty of the game, as normal is really for new players of the game. Any veteran will not find much real challenge in doing it on normal, except to see the game through in under 20 hours and get a take how things now work. ",1,0
"Actually worth buying on-sale for $9.99. I'd give this a 9/10 for the originality behind it. This may seem stupid, simply typing in words to kill zombies but there's way more to the game than just typing. The game has a steam-punk feel to it and the narrations are absolutely funny as hell. I'd highly recommend this for anyone 18+. Give it a shot, you won't regret it. ",1,0

"Nice, touching, catchy and beautiful, just great roguelike fit. The dialogues are great, the voice acting in this game is simple. Well written, there are incredibly touching, heartbreaking moments. When you just get imbued with the main characters of Cerberus. There is also a certain amount of humor, which amuses in places and even leaves a smile. The surroundings are great, maybe some things (like black gods) may not be pleasant, but in this game it did not cause me a reaction of rejection, unlike other representatives of similar SJW, like TV shows, games, etc. Is it the very fact that the game in any case tells us about not quite canonical mythology (Hades is a worker, at a desk, with a seal, furiously falling like an avalanche in a whisper saying ""Denied"" to the souls of the dead, and Zagreus himself), or just incredibly beautiful, beautiful art design of characters ... At a height, good replay value, a lot of blessings, and depending on their combinations (and sometimes you can get paired blessings if two gods have certain ones) you can play in completely different ways. This is not to mention the fact that you will discover later, weapon improvements that change them in the bud. Both those that are dropped as you run, and just permanent improvements that open different types of weapons (they have 4 in total. Default, and 3 others, which improve and add different passives or bonuses under certain conditions, or change certain attacks , but even the default ones when improving weapons become more cheerful, adding either crit or a chance to dodge, depending on the fluff). And I have not yet discovered everything. Endgame content can delight hardcore players with race conditions that can make your life ... Problematic ... And there are tons of them. And in the end - A LOT OF FUCKING CONTENT ",1,0

"RE2 Remake is an ashtounding game that have made which seemed imposible: get the calssic RE feeling, and adapt it to a present gampeplay. Especially playing in the hardest difficulty, when every bullet counts, and less inventory space (but maybe enemies do dtoo much amage) Talking about the games areas, the Police Deparment is amazing and is full of puzzles to solve. It's deffinetly the best zone of the game. The sewers are an improvement over the original sewers, but I believe the Remaked Lab, is worse than the original lab. But it has some minor flaws, things that wouldn't mind at all if it was new RE game, but being a RE2 Remake we need to have in mind some traits the original game had, but this Remake don't. For example, there is almost no difference betwen the A & B routes of each characters. Also there is no interaction beetwen a character A route and the other one B route as happened on the original game.  In original RE2, both characters will often engage with each other or  talk over a radio from time to time,  plotting about how they're gonna escape the nightmare, about finding Sherry, etc. Even there were a couple of items you coulnd't pick on B route, if you had taken that item during the related A route or even some that you could only get during B route if you have done the right stuff during A route. Summarizing, interaction between the 2 main characters and between the routes, are far worse than the original game Nevertheles, It's a wonderull game, and I hope Capcom will use this game as a base for RE8 than to follow the base of REVII and definetly it's the GOTY of 2019 together with FF XIV: Shadowbringers ",1,0
"The mouse acceleration is terrible. No way to disable it. And no, i wont play this with a controller. ♥♥♥♥ me, after the Batman fiasco, i should have known better. WB pc ports are ♥♥♥♥. Edit 1: With everything on ultra at 1440p i get steady 70 fps, motion blur and depth of field disabled, and with the hd texture pack installed, the game looks blurry. Disabling AA helps a little. Also, MSI Afterburner doesn't work. Edit 2: Tried everything to get rid of the hideous mouse ""smoothing"" or ""acceleration"" or wtf its called. Disabled afterburner, tried every possible setting in nvidia control panel, tried every setting in game... no luck. And its not low fps. I get constant framerate. I give up. Its in the hands of the devs i guess. And i cannot refund this cuz i bought it from another site :( Edit 4: Tried with a controller, and the camera movement its really fluid, but i really cant play and enjoy this type of game with a controller. Im too used to a k+m combo. Edit 5: Okay, so i found this fov mod, and after adjusting the field of view to a more comfortable levels. i feel like the camera movement is more fluid. Im really enjoying the game, and dont give a f about microtransactions. Just dont plan on buying them. Good game overall. But boy oh boy the final grind doesnt pay off.

"Jiashanlin stepped into the first masterpiece of the game industry and successfully created another martial arts style, pushing martial arts from the turn-based system into real-time combat, and grew up with martial arts mentality and eight-link system. The rumor system in the game enriches the world, and even passers-by have stories to share with you. Four kinds of weapons correspond to three kinds of martial arts collocation, and gossip talent multiplies to deal with the battle. From an unidentified orphan to the martial arts leader who envy the passers-by in the harem. + Real-time combat-based martial arts game + Nice Chinese music BGM + Various female characters waiting for you to guide + Rumored system to make NPC's words no longer useless + Show the system to fight another solution-The plot is king, so guessing, no surprise-Sudden return of death- The difficulty of the DLC battle is a great leap forward.

"Despite the closure of Telltale, we still saw the long-awaited finale. After the disastrous New Frontier and the vague Michonne, the developers and writers in particular had to do a tremendous job in order not to lose face once again, especially given the importance of this season (the final, after all). After several games, the studio was finally able to bring the optimization to good quality, the graphics to a decent look, and to bring the village-shading style, which already works perfectly for the atmosphere, to its apogee - the events of the series, nevertheless, unfold in the comic universe, so the picture should be appropriate. Realizing that in the phrase ""interactive cinema"" there is not only the word ""cinema"", the developers have introduced enough gameplay episodes in the last season. So many that after literally five or six locations open for exploration in New Frontier, local locations start to feel dizzy (judging by the standards of the series, of course). There has never been such a variety of gameplay in the series, there are activities for every taste - from killing walkers and hunting fish to collecting collectibles for the interior of your room and archery. QTE has also become more diverse: the traditional ""clicking"" of the Q key has not gone anywhere, but during the game you will definitely notice that such episodes have become more intense and interesting, just pressing Q in time and watching the cut-scene will no longer work. After three seasons of eternal running, we finally have a rather intimate story, the events of which unfold literally within a couple of locations. Due to the intimate nature of what is happening, watching the characters and the development of their relationships is much more interesting, we no longer need to try to escape from the nightmare that is happening around, hide from a psychopath or overthrow the government of the local community (although this, indirectly, was not done without it) - the main time is still devoted interaction of adolescents. Grown up Clementine and AJ find themselves in a boarding school for difficult children, which has survived with their students. Local residents are the same age as the main character, and all sorts of plots follow from this: the usual socialization of teenagers in a team or even first love (if, of course, you want it). In the last season, a lot of time is devoted to the parallels between Lee and Clementine. The latter, like Lee in the first season, has a great responsibility - raising a child who was born after the start of the apocalypse. And if Clem still managed to taste a carefree life in childhood, then AJ was not given such a luxury, so he does not understand a lot: why murder is not always good, what is the atonement for his mistakes, why people often react to his actions differently than he expects. In the course of the game, you will definitely become attached to the ""bungler"" and will be very careful to choose all the lines and actions in order to grow a good person out of him. The game has a ton of references to previous games in the series that will never leave you indifferent: from the obvious parallels between Lee and Clementine, which I wrote about above, to the subtle type of a piece of rock salt in a barn. If you carefully went through the previous seasons, then be sure to pay attention to them and remember the emotions that you experienced during their passage. So did the developers manage to adequately complete the story of Clementine, loved by everyone for 7 years of real time? Definitely yes. We got the final that we deserved, the final that Clementine herself deserved. Telltale left on a high note, and I'm glad Skybound finished this game after they closed, even with all the financial costs involved. This story in season 4 will make someone feel sad, someone angry, someone cry, but definitely will not leave anyone indifferent. And if you like dramatic plots, then I sincerely don't understand why you still haven't plunged into this particular one, it is definitely worth it. ",1,0

"Gothic 2 is my favorite part of the Gothic series. What a wonderful world full of life and death was created by Piranha Bytes (game developers). In particular, the music that accompanies us throughout our adventure pleases and only improves the feeling of the game. Although. I must admit that you cannot play this miracle until you arrange dancing with a tambourine (installing various fixes and patches). Yes, and I have several complaints about the combat system (personally, I am wildly annoyed by the distribution of damage in melee - until you swing the possession of one-handed or two-handed weapons by at least 50%, you will suffer). However, these are my personal quibbles and, together with other pluses, the game can be forgiven for everything. In general, stop reading this review - quickly run to buy this masterpiece of the gaming industry. ",1,0
"The final installment of the ""Nightmare from the Deep"" series. In this part we get to know, our archenemy Davy Jones, better. All feedback from the community were implemented and therefor it's no surprise that this is the most polished one yet from Artifex Mundi. Even when it's not mendatory to have played the first two games I would definitly recommend it to know the whole backstory. Beside the HO (hidden object) parts there are also some little riddles and minigames to spice things up. For people who like just a relaxing round of gaming the casual difficulty will give hints to where head next and mark interactive areas. The expert mode will not do such things, better you know the game already or be prepared for the exploration! The graphic and sounds are amazing and set the scale very high for HOGs.

"My story of acquaintance with the ""world of the Witcher"" I'll tell you right away that So, for the first time I heard about a certain witcher from my acquaintances about in, but never took up the book. I don't know what prevented me from doing it then. And no matter how strange it was, but then I did not pay attention to both the first and the second parts of the games, although they were already played in full. Time passed and now, in a year, I bought ""The Witcher 2"" during the next discount on the game. I really liked the plot of the game, and Geralt swung his sword well. Then I found out that it turns out that the save from the first one can be transferred to the second part of the game! After that, I was seized by the desire to go through the first part. B was successfully purchased, but I would not say that I was delighted with the first minutes spent in this game. On the contrary, the beginning disappointed me. Or maybe I just overestimated the game? In any case, I went through it with a stretch and it took some time to get used to the combat system, meditation modes, etc. In general, for the first time I passed the game through strength, but after passing it, I left a pleasant impression. After that, I went over both parts again. Until The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has not yet reached))) PC, apparently, does not allow, but somehow I'll play The plots of the first and second parts did their job - and I took up the books of Anzhey, and meanwhile I was already in the yard ... Sapkowski intrigued me from the first pages! What is there? It seemed to me that I had not read anything more interesting. Oh, I had no idea that the games have a huge bunch of references to the saga! How nice to notice the references to the works of Sapkowski. And after reading the books, I don't really want to return to Geralt, because we see not the Witcher whom we knew from the cycle of books by Anzhey Sapkowski. But on the other hand, how can you generally be indignant about this if the developers revived Geralt, the very one who was led by the destiny ... The game is a masterpiece. Passed in one breath.

"We finished the first game and we had a lot of question marks in our minds. Who exactly was Rachel Amber? How did he fill Maximillian's void? What happened to Chole Price after the death of his father? How did his mother's decision to take someone new in his life affect him? How did Chole, an exemplary scholarship student and science enthusiast, turn into such a wacky character? The details of the past about Drew, Frank and many more characters appear in this game. Our game is of course a selection-based game. But compared to the first game, the richness of choice here is rather weak and they affect the main story much less. And there are also a lot of points in the game that take away from realism. I mean, while getting answers to the question marks I wrote in the first paragraph and having a nice experience, there are many logic errors and carelessness in the flow of the story. Let's come to the things I liked in the game, instead of the photo frames that we tried to capture with Max's interest in photography in the first game, Chole's interest in graphite came. You have to look for them well in every section. Some of them are very well hidden. As in the first game, it is a nice detail that there are sitting and thinking points in this game. Chole's character that can make fun of everything is transferred very successfully. The best joke was for his stepfather in the garage, ""I swear I didn't do anything mom, he hit himself with the lug wrench ... over and over again ..."". The artistic looks in the section transitions were again successful. The scene where Chole and Rachel watched outside from the train car, the scene in which Rachel knocked down the fiery garbage can, the scene where Chole threw graffiti on the toilet were very successfully edited. With the ending of the story, it was replaced in the short scenes given in the transition to the first game. Especially the unreachability part about Rachel made everything we experienced in the first game appear in our minds immediately. Also, in the first part of the play, the game we played in the schoolyard was very enjoyable and I waited for a scene where we would play this game one more time throughout the whole game. At least you could be offered the opportunity to play once again in the hospital where we visited Drew. So the taste remained in my palate :) In this game, the feature of winning something with discussion has been added to the elections. I think they've added this to take back the time in the first game and to close the gap in the absence of decision-making. But since the choices made in this way did not seriously affect the story, they did not make much sense for me. Also in the game, we almost never saw many things that he said will have an effect on this choice. For example, if you choose to play in the sawmill, he says, for $ 200 and a t-short, it will come at a price, but the game is over and he never even had a conversation. The soundtrack of the game was great again. And in his DLC, we're playing with Max a slice of his little ones. If you are not a heavy fan of the game, I do not recommend it much. I did not find it as successful as the first game, but it is not a bad game to gain more details about the characters. If you haven't played the first game, be sure to start the series with this game. 10 / 6.5 ",1,0

"TL;DR: I played this game 6 years ago solo and I was disappointed as the partner AI was very dumb and wasted bullets and heals rapidly. I played this with a very close and good friend and the game was awesome. It has great combat, very good action moments stellar cutscene direction and graphics ahead of its time, story is pretty average though. So I HIGHLY recommend playing this in coop with a close friend. I also recommend getting the gold edition since it is very cheap and gives more content! Now the resident evil fanbase hated this game as this was the first game that just turned the franchise into an action shooter, there was not a single moment in the entire game which I would call scary or even atmospheric. The hate from the fans was understandable so if you are buying this game for horror elements or anything of the sorts you'll be very disappointed.  The coop mode in this game is simply incredible. It is actually coop in this game unlike other games where you only see your friend maybe revive or heal them and thats about it. In re5 you literally have to manage your inventories together and also strategize for certain areas you can give each other different weapons and then provide bullets to each other and stuff. Items you pick up and have in your inventory can be shared with your friend at any time during gameplay. My friend used handguns and Shotguns throughout the game while I was using SMGs and Sniper rifles this way we easily managed ammo for each other.  The game has two protagonists one being the iconic   and a newcomer to the franchise  . You can pick which character you want to play in online coop and also in singleplayer after you have completed the game once. Chris and Sheva both have a great set of costumes which you can change anytime you want. If you have the DLC you can also play with the iconic   and another newcomer   this DLC can also be played in coop. The game has a very fun mercenaries mode which is very similar to the one in   I was disappointed with the number of character they had in it I wanted to see Hunk, Leon and Claire but the mode is very fun regardless. There is also a versus mode which is really fun and you can pick from a lot of characters. The game has a total of 6 chapters with almost every chapter taking place in a different location. There is a lot of weapon variety in the game and all of the weapons feel very satisfying to shoot. You can unlock infinite ammo for every single weapon in the game if you play this enough and you can only use infinite ammo if the host has allowed infinite ammo for the session. Enemy variety is very similar to Re4, they have copy pasted a lot of the enemies in the first two chapters with just different designs I would say all the boss fights are very fun except the final one which is just simply frustrating and trash also fighting the normal enemies is very very fun as well. It also has a shop system from which you can buy new weapons and also rounds for your grenade launcher. You also have upgrades available for every single weapon just like in re4. The only disappointing thing about this is they didn't bring back the merchant :( Verdict:  When I first played this game I gave it a 7/10 but now after replaying it in ""coop"" it is easily a solid 9/10. It is an excellent action game with pretty much the best coop mode in gaming. ",1,0

"We really have to think that this game is one of the best ever. Like everything ... It has its advantages and disadvantages. Or rather, good side and bad side. First as a ""good side"" we can say that it is one of the best first person shooters, you get addicted buying skins just to show off and a very good competitive game mode. I want to clarify: When it comes to playing competitive it is much better to do it with a team or friends since there is much better communication. Now we are going to analyze the ""negative sides"".

"If you love killing zombies and still have strategies to survive the hordes, Deadly 30 is an excellent acquisition. Deadly 30 would be a style game, being quite simple, difficult and fun. The objective of this game, obviously, would be to survive for 30 days, fighting hordes of zombies, which get stronger and stronger as the days go by. There is a fact about the developers of this game: Iggy Zuk and Gonzossm. Ignatus Zuk works with the development of Indle games, he has a blog and made a post regarding his project, which would be Deadly 30. Link: Gonzossm would be a youtuber who makes parodies of games, series, etc ... with humor ♥ ♥♥♥♥ and quite violent. I recommend taking a look. League of Legends FAIL: Dead Space FAIL: FAIL Shorts Darksiders, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Amnesia: The game has 3 characters: American, Soviet (Russian) and German, both ""satirized"" to add a touch of humor to the game , being: The very patriotic and serious American; The well-stressed and complaining German woman; The silly and fearful Russian; We start with the American and, as the days go by, we will find the other survivors, being able to alternate them during the game. TIP: AVOID THE MAXIMUM THAT THEY DIE, BECAUSE THIS GAME IS HARD WITH 3 CHARACTERS, IMAGINE WITH LESS. In Deadly 30, we have the Craft / Upgrade system, I will explain how it works: along the map, we will find stacks of materials, when getting an X number of them, we can craft items like: Weapons, Turrets, Armors, Barricades and Upgrades to the base. Recalling that, we can find vehicles and dismantle them to give a large amount of materials or chests, which when shooting at them, drops a quantity of materials and ammunition, in addition to the game working on a level system, which goes from level 0 to 13 , releasing Weapons, Turrets and Laser Sight. There is a display located at the top of the screen, indicating the current time, such as dawn, for example. The hordes will only attack with all their might at night. Then, during sunset, the display will beep so that the player is alert and immediately returns to his base. The controls are quite simple; The dubbing is even amateurish, but as I said earlier, the game is quite simple; The graphics are Flash animations made by Gonzossm, that is, it has a violence and a hint of humor, and the difficulty of this game is from medium to high, due to the number of enemies and the variety they present. Deadly 30 is a very simple and cheap game, costing an average of 8 reais, quite fun and very difficult. My suggestion would be to add a cooperative mode (CO-OP), as it would be a lot more fun playing with friends and would slightly decrease the difficulty that the game has, but that should be decided by the developers. If I forget to say something, please put it in the comments. Thankful :) ",1,0

"Forager is a top-down open-world 2D game focused on exploration (clearly inspired in older Zelda games), farming (inspired in games like Stardew Valley) and crafting/building (inspired in games like Terraria).  In Forager you start on a small island and from there you can build your base, level up and improve skills, upgrade equipment, expand network of friends (and enemies!), collect gold coins to expand the map etc. You can play Forager in totally different ways and on the end game create automated ways of harvesting crops and minerals, which in that sense turns it into more of an idle game. The game is quite vast and there is no specific rule to follow on your progression, so the player can use creativity and play however he/she desires to progress.  Pros: - Good Soundtrack - Pleasant Artstyle - Vast crafting/base & skill building options - Several dungeons to explore and bosses to beat Cons: - Since it's an indie title, the player can expect to encounter some bugs - and in this game there are a bunch of them. But thankfully due to the way that the game is designed most of those bugs can be circumvented! E.g.: if the player XP meter gets stuck, spirit orbs can still be used to make the player lvl up, potentially ""unjamming"" the stuck XP meter and/or still reaching the level cap. E.g.2: I had a bug where my character was unable to attack - I pressed the button but nothing was happening, but gathering fishing traps gave me enough XP to level up and that fixed the bug that was keeping me from being able to attack.

"Halo: Reach, Spark of Courage, is the latest game in the series to be produced by Bungie. And they decided to devote their last project to the battle for Rich, which, in fact, decided the outcome of all further events. The story in this part is devoid of the heroic pathos inherent in numbered units and is more like a kind of military newsreel. In which we and our Noble squad are given the most important place in this story;) Under our control they again give a Spartan under the call sign Noble-6, devoid of any individuality. And from his face we will see how Rich dies: from the beginning of the invasion, to the natural and gloomy end (I never thought that I would cry from the final scene. And goose bumps will go from the monologue). Gameplay ... This is another Heilo from Bungee. With traditionally good and spacious maps, moderately smart enemies from the Covenant and a good soundtrack by Martin O'Donell. This part is distinguished by perhaps a more down-to-earth and devoid of pathos attitude, an excellent compilation of the `` best moments '' from all the past games in the series: Here is a stealth mission at night, where you can work with a sniper rifle. And a mission, where they give a large map (in the spirit of 3) and offer to ride on several points along the way, destroying harmful aliens. There is even a mission in the spirit of the second part, where we have to fly and fight back in the air! Also, for the first time in the series, it is here that they give a little flight in space, which is very good. Perhaps it was Rich's down-to-earthness, coupled with the presentation of the story, that brought out his negative sides for me: 1. The story is again about the Spartans. Why? Not to say that this is bad. But the same ODST clearly showed that Heilo can tell a story about ordinary people and almost nothing because of this not to lose, but on the contrary to gain ... And I think that Rich's fall on behalf of an ordinary person could have been more dramatic. 2. Perhaps the format of military operations is not mine. But the first half of the game (before the mission in space) the events did not touch at all and went in passing. Because of the format, I didn’t even really like my partners. Yes, they appear in cut scenes, a number of missions. But I didn’t feel any attachment to them, and as a result I didn’t feel much then I empathized :( Bottom line: great Heilo and just a good prequel with a great ending. I recommend.

"Yes, he is shocked. Yes, the developers were bombarded with substances to create an original plot. No, just the head explodes, especially from the endings of the DLS - such a trash ... The radio is cool; Russian language is cool! But I would rather watch and listen to all this without subtitles, so I perfectly understood everything in the language from a parallel universe. Once we play with my sidekick Oleg in a mission with Asha, where you have to do everything in stealth. And you know what? We went through it for an hour and a half, it was just amazing how they bombed and on the 21st attempt we finished it. The lamps were not destroyed just like that, the textures are the opposite, the guards hated the boxes / boxes; blen, yes yomayo, why live and suffer like that when there are so many bugs?

"A deck-building roguelike card game like Slay the Spire with the addition of dice. Rather than just competing for the size of the roll, it is interesting that the optimum roll changes depending on the card used. There are 6 classes in total, which are unlockable, and you can enjoy different experiences with each unique ability. Compared to StS, it's much more casual, the rules are simple, the lap is short and you can play casually, but on the other hand he has few types of cards and may lack depth. As of August 17, 2019, there is no Japanese, but it will be supported soon. Since the description of the card is simple, there is not much inconvenience even if it is in English. The cute character and the nice chiptune are also attractive and I would like to recommend it, but one thing he cares about is that the dice rolls do not seem to be random. When I checked the outcome of the enemy who can only attack with an odd number, I got an odd number 12 times in a row. Of course, it's possible that it's a coincidence, but it's hard to believe because the probability is 0.02%. For those who can play games with such specifications. ",1,0
"*NOTE: This is an Early Access review meaning it will be a lot shorter than a normal review but will still explain what I thought about it. A full review will be published once Sky Nations has released. Also note that I have over 15 hours on the game and I played it when it wasn't on Steam; when it had its own launcher. Construct Airships and wage war in a sandbox world populated by floating islands, sprawling skies and adventure. Ride on ships and build them while your motley drive you forward, toward exploration. Persistent player servers and much more await! Sky Nations is available on Steam and is being developed and published by Damaged, which as far as I know, is a one-man developing team. I am going to start off by talking about the graphics because they are part of the reason why the game works so well. Yes; it's another voxel game. But that doesn't stop it from being creative on what it aims to be. There are new textures and new blocks such as laser blocks, engines, and a lot more. The textures feel fresh and not just thrown in there to be there. This allows players to have a sort of relaxed feeling as they are riding on their self-made space ships, looking at the ""scenery"". An awesome part to the game is how easily players can get going on their space ship. It also provides for a fun experience with easily being able to get minerals, add defense to your ship, and join other factions. There are plenty of parts to craft for your ship, allowing for some neat customization options.  I do have a few gripes with the game at its current state. One, I dislike the system of being able to steal from other people's ships. The reason I dislike this is because, as I was a new player once, newbies will play the game for a few hours, get a nice ship, probably not be invited into a nice faction, and then log off. The next day their ship will be looted and then they would have to start from square one; which I have to say is very frustrating. Although it does add a little survival aspect to it, it's definitely disappointing. Another gripe I have is with the server connection. When you want to have ship battles with other people and/or fight them 1v1 the battle will be all over the place because of the connection lag, which drops the intensity of the game to almost laughable. Lastly, this game is not very original. You can easily get some mods for Minecraft that either have the same amount of content or more than, which is disappointing.  Although it is overall a great game, bringing some new textures and a neat voxel space system to the table, it lacks on a few key features. 6.5/10 ",1,1

"This is a pretty interesting little game, with a few puzzles that might take you a bit of time to figure out if your don't look them up, a story that starts a bit cliche but then it introduces some peculiar characters and makes some decent ""plot twists"" as we find out more about the main character. Now I might be biased in this review as I have recieved this game for free, but if you have any doubts about it you can check my live, blind playthrough of it right here and hopefully it will help you make up your mind:   . There have been many games made in this style and it's very difficult to come with something new. While the gameplay or mechanics don't have anything innovative in them, I feel like the story is interesting enough to give it a shot. And it also has multiple endings, so you can do things differently than I did in the video and see where that leads you. With a little bit of comedy and some horror elements I think this game should keep you busy enough for the amount of money it costs, especially at a sale. ",1,0

"even with its changes and problems related to combat and its artificial intelligence, bugs in the scenario and other details that can be corrected with updates, the defects present in Skyrim do not take away from its strengths: The feeling of freedom and the narrative. The possibility for you to create any type of character and behave differently in each game, the side stories that are also huge (Example: Thief's Guield, The Dark Brotherhood) and that show other facets of a gigantic, complete and cohesive storyline, make The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the list of the best RPGs you may have played in your life.

There is already talk about payed DLC i think they should hold off on any payed DLC and first fix the game so it runs smoothly for more players(or runs at all) and then work on some DLC to say sorry for the rocky launch and go from there. 2019 EDIT: ill leave the original negative review as it was from launch, its took them years but they finally got the game where it was supposed to be at launch,and it is a pretty great game now,a few things i would have done differently but still a lot of fun well worth your $30,give it a shot if you have not already:) ",1,0

"I'll start this review off by saying I suck at platformers, and I NEVER leave reviews. This game has enamored me so much that I not only have played it to death these last few days but gave me such a good time that I felt indebted to leave a review. When playing this game I've regularly been streaming it for people to watch for 1-5 people in my discord server as and when they come in to see how I'm doing. The first thing that hits them, like me, is just how stunningly beautiful the game is and how fluid the animations are. They audibly laughed at the execution animation for the large shield enemies likening the kill-move to a jam sandwich due to the gore. The links to catholicism and religion are so gripping, everything in the game feels like it has purpose and meaning. Nothing ever felt out of place. (Probably helps that I was brought up in a religious family) The combat satisfying and I never felt like I had to grind for anything, its also a much bigger game than I thought, I had gotten to a key point of the gaming expecting it to be one of the final bosses on the bridge only to find that I was perhaps under halfway. (it helped I didn't notice the percentage of completion under my save-file back then haha) I've been reading other reviews saying that it doesn't get or understand dark souls. But it's not trying to be a dark souls clone, its a game that very much stands up on its own, that does it's own things in it's own style, it has nods and love notes in there to darksouls but it doesn't need a crutch of another game to hold itself up. I can't encourage people enough to buy and support and this game, its been so long that I've genuinely had so much fun and love for a game such as this. Will definitely be eyeing up for any DLC or Blasph 2 so I can support more! Much love to these amazing devs thank you so much for this. I can assure you I've already got atleast 3 of my friends to pick up this game. ",1,0

"I have been a long time fan of the Conan franchise since I first saw the movies back in the 1980's. Since then, I discovered Age of Conan about 5 years ago and fell in love with the non-auto-attack combat system. Conan Exiles in Early Access has been a wonderful experience as a gamer and as a fan of the Conan syndicate. Below is a brief explanation of why I feel this game will be a huge success when it launches and why early access has been in my opinion greatly successful in achieving its goals. 1. Competitive price. I have been on Steam for almost 3 years and as far as I can see the price of this software is not only competitive but offers far more than other MMO's do with no monthly subscription. That is a huge plus, recurring fees to play games are very unattractive for many of us. 2. No paywalls or cash shop purchases for content. The content for this game is largely driven by the Steam workshop and the developers at Funcom. There is no cash shop or special coins, crowns or other virtual currency needed to purchase access to content. 3.Outstanding communication between end users and community leaders/devs. I have had a great pleasure taking part in the development of this game by submitting suggestions on Steam as wells as bug reports on the official Funcom managed forums for the game. It is really exciting when a developer sends you a personal message and asks for your help with something. It has been a pleasure to work with the mod builders and devs at Funcom for Conan Exiles. 4.Amazing living biospheres. The exiled lands you spend your game time in are in an ever evolving, non-static world. You can watch as clouds form in the sky and a thunderstorm rolls in. See the rage of the deadly sandstorms taking shape and find shelter before you are devoured in the abrasive torent. No matter where you are the climate and weather have a huge impact on your gameplay and survival skills. 5.Visually appealing. In every aspect of the game, the visual content, whether its the character model or the armor and weapon skins or the landscape of the world around you, the visual appeal will keep you interested in the game and giver you a desire to explore. 6. Rich crafting and building system. The craft and build systems in Conan Exiles is so full feature I could write a review based only on this aspect. Let me just say that if you enjoy collecting and building without many limitations, this game will indulge your imagination. I have over 500 hours of early access. Yes, there have been bugs and crashes. Yes, I got frustrated with gameplay issues. But I have beta tested a few games in my years of gaming and always feel its a privilege to have access to a game before its released. I salute the Steam Workshop devs and the whole team of Community Support and Developers at Funcom for making this Early Acess game, in my opinion, a huge success. ",1,0
"So I went into the game for the first time ... nice, interesting ... ran ... the first fight, so, yeah, headshots here aren’t kicking ... hmm, for 10+ lvl I went into the TZ, left a little later and did not go. .. I went through the plot, but how, lvl 30 dude dragged me through the remaining locations and voila, I ""passed"" the game ... Then I was engaged in collecting audio recordings, etc. ... I got bored ... These are the main impressions of the game In general I don’t want to write anymore ... The game seems to be cool, but the plot is short, the rest of the time it’s natural PVP ... How easy it would be to go in and shoot, I can also go to the CS Survival mode, yes, it’s cool. and I don’t want to go in to play something ... To all of these I don’t want to say that the game is bad, I just don’t really like MMOs. Thanks for all... ",1,0
"Pull the Snowden case back in 2013. When he was accused of spying for leaking sensitive United States security information and revealing in detail some of the surveillance programs the country uses to spy on the American population - using company servers like Google, Apple and Facebook - and several countries in Europe and Latin America. Imagine that one of these surveillance programs is Orwell, it's all you need to know about the game. Orwell has a ton of information, but because it's a short game and with an extremely effective system, nothing gets boring, so don't worry. As you would expect in games of this type, your choices have a lot of weight, especially in the end. The only requirements for playing are a little patience and intermediate English. ",1,0

"+ Full crack / dubbing + subtitles /. + Dialogues often funny, though sometimes underdeveloped - artificially accelerated. + Better game than in the previous version (2), no wonder after many years. The two were a bit sluggish in playing. Somehow I quickly quit gaming. Skyrim was close to completion, but probably not finished. In Wieśku 3, being heavy with rubbish, so much does not interfere with the fight. There is still some time left to complete the game. Autosaves sometimes spoil the game.

The latter are diluted a little in single player but cmq some passages that will make you think. The game also has a good longevity and graphically has aged very well. You can play in 4k at 60fps the glance remains pleasant. Also recommended in 2020. 8/10 rating ",1,0

"for context, i've been an indie game developer for around 20 years, and have used a lot of programs to create pixel art in that time. i'm primarily a programmer but have spent a lot of time doing the pixel art for my games as well. i've made over 14 games, most using pixel art, all 2D. the programs i've used to make pixel art have been paint shop pro, neopaint, photoshop, gimp, mario paint (which was the first one i ever made pixel art in, as a kid playing around with it on the snes), in-built pixel art tools in the ohrrpgce and game maker engines, and many others.  until now, my favorite by far has been cosmigo pro motion, and that did pretty much everything i needed, and had a free version that had all the features i needed. in pixel art communities i've seen threads about 'what do you use to make pixel art' and this name kept coming up that i hadn't heard of before: ""aseprite"", so i decided to buy it and take a look. and the result is aseprite edges even cosmigo pro motion out of the best pixel art program i've used. i don't want to go into detail exactly as to why since others have done so well enough in other reviews. there are also a few small gripes i have with it (for instance, no easy way to change which color you have selected with the keyboard alone, you have to either use the eyedropper and the mouse or click on the color manually, and no real option to draw with the keyboard / control the cursor), but overall it's awesome. i'm using it for a commision i'm being paid for to do art for another indie's game, and it's been great for that so far. i would not absolutely say never use anything else because there are certainly other programs that have advantages. if i were still using cosmigo pro motion i'd still be fine with that, and may even use it again (for some specialized features which this one doesn't have). but if you want to try out a new program to do pixel art, this is the top of the line.

"I've had this in my library for a few years but had never played it. I noticed it was very cheap on sale so wanted to give it a go as a recommendation to others, and to knock one off my unplayed list. Only 1600 to go?! Send help... Like more detail? Good, I like writing... Guards is a simple turn based strategy game from the developer of Warstone TD (which I loved) where you play a team of four different heroes, each with a standard attack and a special attack. You have a small grid that allows three heroes to stand at the front and one at the back. To take your turn, you have to switch any two heroes. You can't choose to keep them in formation, they have to move to progress the game. The heroes at the front get hit by waves of monsters, each with melee, ranged or special abilities, whilst the hero at the back heals. Switching from back to front activates a heroes special ability. You need to switch around your tanks, healers and ranged damage, whilst keeping in mind the special abilities, until you defeat the designated number of monsters and win the level. At the end of the level you can upgrade heroes with gold for that run. If a single hero dies, it's game over, although there are some items you can equip and use as well, including a resurrection rune which can help save one death. After the game is over, you get runes which you can spend on meta progression or unlocking new heroes. Other than upgrades, you can buy and equip items, and complete quests which help progression go faster with rewards. It is quite grindy and you will have to die quite a few times to unlock what you need to progress, which is a little frustrating because the levels are very similar so playing them over and over again to farm runes doesn't really need much different strategy - although once you unlock all the heroes and play further, you've got more options. It does feel like I'm hitting a wall not because I'm not employing the best strategy, but because I simply don't have the stats upgraded yet so I think there is room for better balance.  Despite the grind, I like the game. It's aesthetically pleasing, it has a unique and interesting mechanic, the heroes you unlock are quite interesting and playing requires a good amount of thought. I'm not sure it really has a massive amount of replayability in it, but I do think it is well-made. ",1,0

I don't think it's suitable for people who say, ""I should be a man,"" or ""This game doesn't portray reality. Reality is more severe."" Oh, I think it's not fun to do it unless you can shed it lightly because there is such a way of thinking.

"is a wacky game that's not really golf, but still maintains the golf theme in every stage that you play one way or another. Don't look at this game and think you will actually get to play a real golf/minigolf game, that's just not going to happen. It starts off benign enough, with the standard thought of using a player-selected direction and force to get a ball to a flag/hole. It doesn't wait very long before it gets out of hand, however, when the flag starts moving, or the thing that you need to get to the flag becomes a golf club, your own playing character, or even the direction/force arrow. The game is broken down into different sections, each with smaller sections that have doors that you can progressively open by completing the available levels. Some places will require you to do the additional challenges associated with the stages present. Every stage has three different tasks for you to accomplish, and some of them get pretty tough. Not long after diving into the main campaign, you will start encountering other sections where the game parts/levels are inspired by other games, such as   etc. Pretty soon you will find yourself trying to use the baseline golf concept to complete other sports objects, such as volleyball, soccer, track and field, bowling, and so on. And of course you are going to be trying to perform some ridiculous tasks such as well, stuff that you never thought you would be doing, like throwing office equipment or boxes, or uprooting your whole house. At the beginning of some levels, it's not clear what your objectives are or what you are supposed to do. But fiddle around a little bit and pretty soon you will be on your way to trying to make it through a potentially funny, wacky, silly, or frustrating level.  I did a first-look video of this game when I started, and it was just mostly me getting used to the game and playing through the first of three sections of each stage, you can see it here: I thought that the other two sections of each stage was actually meant to be the same thing, just a little bit tighter restrictions, but later on I found out otherwise. They are all different. Who knows what was going on in the heads of these developers when they managed to put this game together. However they managed and ended up with an absolutely hilarious non-golf golf game that's going to be boatloads of fun, especially if you are playing with your family and friends watching. Everyone is going to have a good time. Another thing you can expect to see is a lot of puns, some funny, some corny, some just plain trying too hard. But whatever, it's just part of the game, I am really enjoying seeing what it's going to throw at me next, or at least make me throw next. In addition to the main campaign, there are also daily challenges and leaderboards. You can use the level editor to start making your own ridiculous levels as well. For those creative minds out there, you could probably challenge yourself and see what levels you can come up with that are more ridiculous than what the developers managed. You will also find a local 2-player Party mode that also supports Remote Play Together, and I think as a party game, this has a lot of laughs and discussions to contribute. You can play the whole game with just your mouse, so the other hand's good for holding a beer. Simple low-poly artwork that works pretty well with the ridiculousness of this game. It's got some catchy tunes and generic sound effects. Overall works well together. Not for everyone, there are quite a few levels/challenges that have timed components or various levels where you need to act fast. So people who do not want to see these kinds of levels might get stuck in some frustrating areas. If you hold down the mouse click time slows down, so that might be helpful. But if you absolutely cannot deal with time-sensitive levels, then you will probably be more frustrated instead of having fun. If you wanted a real golf game, well, this has almost every aspect in life in the game, with minimal golf, so play at your own risk. If you already have seen some gameplay videos and want to try it out just to have some laughs with friends and family, then absolutely, check it out. Its base price is $19.99, but during the launch-week sale right now, you can get it for 30% off, so that's a pretty good deal.  is as ridiculous as any screenshots, videos, or reviews you may have read about on this game. It's not a golf game, so don't expect that. But it has every other aspect of life in low-poly representation that offers a really memorable experience. 8/10 ",1,0
"""Vampire"" is an ARPG game by DONTNOD Entertainment, the production team of ""Life is Strange"". This work still inherits the production team's aesthetic and moving storytelling advantages, so how does it perform in other aspects? In fact, this game has been shown as early as 2016, but the production cycle is too long, and it was only released in June 2018. So its picture level is at most only the level of the first generation in 2015. The game is built with Unreal 4 engine. The vegetation, texture, and depth of field are actually very rough, which is not up to the HD level of this generation. However, it has done a good job in light reflection, and the character modeling and facial modeling are also relatively good. Generally speaking, the picture technology of this game itself is relatively mediocre, and it will be released after a few years of delay. There is no bright spot. However, as a HD game of this generation, the picture of this game is still sufficient, which can clearly distinguish it from the pseudo HD game at the end of the previous generation. This is a highlight of this work. The melodious music is enough to reflect the living environment of the nobles in London in the early 20th century. The BGM and the beautiful night scene of the city are very consistent. The BGM of several districts are different, and it is entering some dark and closed environments. , BGM also changed accordingly, becoming weird and frightening. While the protagonist is sucking blood, the BGM also vividly brings out the horror and weirdness of the vampire, and the BGM of the BOSS battle makes the players excited. In terms of sound effects, the dubbing of this work is also in place, whether it is a wooden stick, a machete, a dagger, or an iron cone, these sound effects fit the battle scene very well. In general, the sound effects of the entire game can fully show the elegance of European style. ① Stiff action: This is the part most criticized by players. In fact, it is not that unbearable. It is not that the game’s hit feel is not good, but that the motion capture is not well done, and the action is slightly stiff, especially when running is unpleasant. The phenomenon of ""space sliding"" will also appear during the battle. In fact, the phenomenon of space sliding in other games will make the game's operating feel greatly compromised. In this work, the protagonist, as a vampire, shows space sliding instead of being so unruly and even handsome?? But All enemies in the entire game will also have the effect of space sliding. This effect is not only ugly, but it will also cause a lot of pressure on the player in the battle. ②Strike sense: As I just mentioned, this work is not that the strike feel is bad. In fact, the strike feel is quite good. The strike counter is done well. If you hit the enemy with various weapons, different sound effects and stiff effects will appear. The hit part will also react differently because of your slashing angle, especially when the enemy's HP is very low. When you kill the enemy, the enemy will be affected by your killing angle and killing action. If you fall to a different enemy, the surrounding objects will be destroyed. For example, if the enemy is stabbed to death with my sword, he will stagger a few pieces because of my sword and fall on the wooden cart. If the impact is great, the enemy will knock the wooden cart over and fall to the ground. The visual effect of such an anti-fighting style is great. So this game is not that the hit feel is bad, but the motion capture is not good. Many people can’t distinguish between the hit feel and motion capture and just make presumptuous comments. This is not desirable. Strictly speaking, the production of action modeling is only part of the shock. The sense of shock is a very esoteric and cumbersome question. The sense of shock has certain criteria for judging it. It is not so-called ""different from person to person"", nor is it a psychological feeling. The sense of shock in video games and movies follows Realistic physics laws are restored as much as possible to create a realistic and refreshing ""sense of blow"". Therefore, if you do not have certain game experience and detailed research on the professional information about the shock, you should not use your own ""feel"" to evaluate the shock of a game. Otherwise, the media won't have to score games and movies. Of course, you can comment on the product after you buy it, but it’s not advisable to make comments and nonsense at will. ③Skill tree: The skill design of this game can be said to be unique, and the skill interface is simple and clear, allowing players to understand at a glance. There are multiple common skills, and the player has 4 common skills shortcut keys. That is to say, you can learn these common skills as long as you have experience points, but you can carry 4 skills when you enter the battle at the same time. And there is also a more powerful ""big move"", 3 super skills for players to choose, but only one can be selected when entering the battle. This means that if the player wants to become strong enough, he must learn more specifically, and not learn randomly. And learning skills is to sleep on the bed in the safe house. You can't learn skills at ordinary times, but you can change the wearing of the skills you already have. Players do not need to worry about learning the wrong skills and this file is over. You can completely reset the skills you have learned when you sleep without spending extra experience points. ④Weapon system: The weapon system of this game is also more exciting, because the production concept of this game is to let players struggle in the choice of vampire killing and doctor saving people. If you bloody NPC, you will get a lot of experience points and quickly improve your Vampire skills, and if you don't embrace the NPC, you have very little experience, so you can only use a handy weapon to counter the enemy. In this way, the weapon system of the game has played a big role. Although there are not many weapons in the game, the matching method is worth exploring. Weapons are divided into blunt weapons and sharp weapons, as well as one-handed weapons and two-handed weapons. One-handed weapons can be equipped with a pistol or iron cone, while two-handed weapons cannot be equipped with another auxiliary weapon, but they can defend against enemy attacks, and the tremor caused can stun the enemy. Weapon coordination skills have produced players of multiple genres. Players who don't want to bloody NPCs and players who follow the route of evil vampires play completely different ways. ⑤ Perspective lock: This is the biggest criticism of this work. The design of the production team's keyboard and mouse player operation. When the player uses the mouse and keyboard operation to lock the enemy, as long as the mouse lens is moved, the locked object will be converted, which completely loses the meaning of locking. Because of the keyboard and mouse operation, it is necessary to shake the mouse during the battle. It is because you want to hit a person to use the lock function, and this design makes the keyboard and mouse players unable to lock the enemy. But this seems to affect the game experience very much. In fact, what I want to explain here is that the ""angle of view"" in the ACT game and the ""aim assist"" in the shooting game are designed for the handle, because the handle cannot be used like a mouse. Aiming at 360° in all directions, so in 3D free-view games, the mouse has more freedom, so if you are a mouse and keyboard player, then you can just close the enemy directly. If you want to use the enemy to lock, then you can plug in the handle to play~ It is worth mentioning that many of the BOSS battles in this game are designed very well, using the characteristics of science and vampires, designing the BOSS image and moves, from different aspects Bring difficulties and challenges to players. This is the best part of this work. The game describes London in 1918, which was invaded by disease after World War I. With the late autumn night, miserable scenes can be seen everywhere. The atmosphere is well portrayed. The player needs to act as an excellent surgeon, and become a vampire after experiencing ""resurrection from the dead"". Make difficult choices in the painful struggle of doctors saving people and vampires killing people. What's interesting is that all NPCs in this game can be embraced by you, and the mainline NPC will give you options after the mainline advances to a certain level, allowing you to decide his fate. Every player's decision will result in a different ending, and the biggest problem is that this game cannot be manually archived, that is, it cannot be ""re-read the big deal"" like other games. The design concept of this game is Let this game be the same as life, without giving you a chance to read files, you never know the consequences of the choices you make in the future. (It deserves to be the production team that made Life is Strange =. =) The story and reason the game tells is also relatively clear, and I don't explain much about it to avoid spoilers.

"Life is Strange 2 not as good as Life Is Strange but still a good competitor, compared to the first season this one is more focused on dialogues and characters than on actions and quick time events.   This game puts you in the position of an alpha wolf, you have to take care of your little brother which got something a little bit special. You two are going through a lot just to get to Puerto Lobos - Mexico, at your dad's childhood home. You'll gonna meet a lot of strangers most of them will become friends, you'll do things that a normal person wouldn't do and you will do whatever it costs to keep your little brother with you.

"Very good some key elements from the original doom also some elements from quake 2 with the quad damage what can us e with your weapon array. within short time to wipe out the demons and other monster before the time is up. They have move with story very close to the original. The only thing what i like is that can nou upgrade your weapons also your battle suite to progress to the  levels up.

"I suppose im over due writing a review of this. I dirst played warframe back when there was a lot less too it and didnt find much appeal as the asthetics of the warframes wasnt to my tastes but hey some time later I gave it another go. Although essentially all the game is, is a grind on 4-5 different game modes, it has continued to suprise me with detail in mechanics and all the small things. It is a strong medium-fast past space/planetary shooter/hack and slash with a large focus on crafting what you need. If this game had more law behind it something that drives you to find out more of what happened here and what happened there it would easily make this game more of a current favorite then it already is. I recommend this game to people who enjoy third person games and playing with friends, if you are not one for the grind sadly this game may not be for you. ",1,0

"Ahhhh if you read my last review for Pink Hour you know how excited I was to play this one. And well.... it did deliver once again and put a smile on my face the whole time through!. The events take place after Pink Hour where you are warped into what seems a lab as you talk to your ""boss"", then you are sent to heaven where the main game takes place. I really won't say much else as the game is short so it would be pretty much spoilers but I will say this one has 2 levels and a umbrella upgrade which was a nice touch (the umbrella would let you hover after you jump letting you skip from place to place). All in all this was another joyride of happiness and I still highly suggest you play both of the games! I hope KeroBlaster is just as good. (oh and it's confirmed that the main character is a girl potato.) Pros:  - 2 levels  - Still has hardmode after you finish the main game, which means replay value - Free  - Controlling miss potato feels solid for the most part! - Funny and cute story. Cons:  Even though there really isn't cons to the game I will just list a couple things that felt weird while playing. - I didn't address this during the first game's review, but when you start shooting you are stuck into that position. So if you are shooting straight you are stuck to shooting straight and can't shoot anywhere else unless you stop completely and aim in the other direction and start shooting agian. It doesn't bug me much but it can for sure get a little annoying. - Even though the umbrella was a pretty nice touch it didn't really seem useful for most of the second level except a few parts, and for just the story itself. Also sometimes if you jump from block to block to fast you will most likely trigger the umbrella which can as well get a little annoying. Really nothing game breaking just a couple things to talk about since the game doesn't really have any cons lol  Thank you to the team who created this little fun game and I hope you keep making them ! ",1,0
"You can start by saying that I have never played a game of this genre. All Ubisoft games passed me, except for Assassin's Creed (1-4) and FarCry 2, which for some unknown reason I really liked. So the newcomers of this genre will love the game (although the price is a little overpriced). Even before the OBT (or rather, on the day it started) I bought the Deluxe Edition in the hope that the game will not disappoint me. And personally, I almost did not disappoint. Let's start discussing the pros and cons. 1. The plot. Many people complain about the plot, they say, it's not there at all or it's just for show. What could be the plot in a game in which only one specific operation in the country was given, or rather, the destruction of the drug cartel. Yes, it would be possible to twist a good plot using certain series or films. But, given that we play as operatives and perform 1 operation, he is not really needed. 2. Graphics Again, someone will start whining that the graph has not improved in any way, and so on. etc. Let's take into account that for many of them the game barely pulls even at low settings. On my 1060 I squeezed 60 fps very high and ultra and was quite satisfied, there are no such special moments to which you can find fault with much. And I'm not particularly picky about the graphics, because all the time that I can remember myself, I played on an old dinosaur, which CS: GO barely pulled out at the lowest settings and in low resolution. 3. Gameplay. At first it is very interesting, but after about 15 hours it can be quite boring, because most of the tasks boil down to one thing: ""Go there, interrupt everyone, take the documents - go away"" Koop did not appreciate, because most of the games I play solo. I was very pleased with the extensive customization of weapons, as well as the arsenal itself, which allows you to kill dumb NPCs with whatever we like. 4. Physics. Physics cannot be justified in any way. Machines behave goddamn it, shooting is also mediocre. In 4 years, such a large company could have done better. 5. Open world. He is beautiful, interesting to explore (relatively), he is, I would say, a masterpiece, if not for one ""but"". It is empty. There is nothing that can lure or compel people to explore this world. Except for some nice screenshots. 6. Optimization. At the OBT stage, it still lags a little, occasionally the FPS drops to 0 for a few seconds, but in general the game does not interfere. 7. Bugs. There are a lot of bugs, interesting bugs, from simple graphical (flickering shadows, light objects, etc.) to the funniest (civilian cars in the middle of the road take off into the stratosphere and the like) But where have we seen a game without bugs at Ubisoft? True, with very few exceptions, nowhere. Perhaps they will finish everything. Total: a very interesting project, a little overpriced, has many bugs and not very good optimization. An interesting solo process and, most likely, a very fun co-op. A mix of FarCry, Just Cause and .. Division? Perhaps (and most likely) I did not touch on many positive and negative aspects due to my laziness, not a very good memory, or simply forgot. I will rate it 7/10, considering that the game will develop. Thanks for reading and good luck, patience and good friends to destroy the cartel. ",1,0

"The only changes since then are rare bug fixes, beauty creams, maps submitted to Scream Fortress & Smissmas, and location fixes. There is very little communication from the development team on the state of the game. Additionally, there is no real confirmation that a new major update will be made again (much less if a "" heavy day ""actually exists). There are rumors that we continue to work with content creators like VNN ... I don't feel like there is a TF2 development team already. A controversial play coordinator unfolded with the competition (almost imbalanced today and hardly anyone plays), before updating the difficult break of December 17, 2015 (That was more or less Gun Mettle 2.0). Two major fixes in the past four years ... Playing TF2 was a magical experience ... dating back to 2014. I love this game and had so much fun. Lift the valve through the trade and the keys. The sad truth is that the golden age of gaming is over. Yes the game is still fun but damn it ... it really deserves a lot better. One of the most played games on Steam today, but I don't care about the lackluster reality of Valve anymore. TF2 didn't start with a lot of history. There was no room for one. But as the updates got more ambitious, we've found the perfect way to explore the world of mercenaries: the comics. Over the years, the comics have spawned auxiliary characters and then assistants of the auxiliary characters. The companies mentioned in passing have grown into three generations of global empires. The game that started out as a handful of guys in a desert shooting each other slowly turned into the most labyrinthine story in Valve history. ",1,0

"No matter how badly the gameplay was, the story still felt like it was coming to an end, but this little gameplay is really flawless, but the story is hellish. Degree. And this is an element that makes me like and dislike, but there are elements that are unique to Megisol, but there are no elements that are like the previous work. In comparison with the series' best masterpiece, Megisol 3, Megisol 3 has a lot of interesting content that can only be seen by playing the story and storage several times. Actually, I didn't think of it well when I was playing because it was a level that I couldn't even have a gag element, but... Speaking of maps, this small open world method allows you to freely roam around a wide map. Adopting the open world is not bad, but this is not a damn wide map to the end, there are two or three moderately wide maps, and it is a way to use these maps. There is no dissatisfaction with this point itself, but the way the map changes is a problem. All of the map changes are made on board the helicopter, but this is impossible to skip. You have to unconditionally waste about a minute while riding the helicopter to the drop zone. If you write it down, you won't feel it, but if you play this game, this process comes to us as hellish and tired. I did list only the shortcomings, but in fact, even if I don't think about all of these things, I have little time to think about anything else because I focus on the gameplay when I play. There is no problem with purchasing even if you look at the game only. You can almost do everything you thought in stealth games. This is a little bit of a side note, but there is a girl who had a little controversy before the release called Quiet. This is the only girl among the guys who are actually sweating in this game. Do it. ",1,0

"It's a decently good game. There's not much to say that isn't already said in the game's store page description; nice graphics, tunes, voice acting, game mechanics, Trading Cards, etc; Sure, I managed to play as all the characters, though unlocking some wasn't easy because at least one involved online matches and barely anyone plays ""Oh...Sir!!"" anymore. 😕 The only real major problem I have with this game are the Achievements regarding putting together certain phrases. The chances of finding the exact lines to make those phrases like ""Your hovercraft is full of eels"", ""Your son died because of your sins!"", ""You still use Windows Vista and never watched Star Wars"" is almost second to none. I tried making ""A duck hunter probably murdered this poor man"", which can only be done at the Lake stage, along with ""Your son died because of your sins!"" using Father as one of the combatants, as a 2-player Couch Mode; over an hour later with dozens of purposely unfinished sentences per round, the required lines for those phrases just never showed up together, leaving me in annoyance and taking away the fun of gameplay. I've got a good mind to use Steam Achievement Manager to acquire those incomplete Achievements not as ""cheating"" but telling the devs to get rid of those specific Achievements altogether. 😒 Also, every Tournament game has the player going through each stage in the same order; Pet Shop, By The Lake, Train Compartment, ER and The Afterlife (with Father as the final boss). While it does kinda make sense how each Scenario leads to the next, I don't think it would've hurt to mix the stages up a bit for each character's Tournament...but that's probably because I played the sequel, which did have that feature...but the opponent was the same each time for the corresponding stage, so I suppose it evens this out between the two games. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Bottom line, ""Oh...Sir!! The Insult Simulator"" IS worth playing...just don't expect to ever complete the Achievements and add another Perfect Game to your Profile's record. 🙄 ",1,0

"So, my dear Skyrimushka, your time has come. I would write a serious review, put everything on the shelves, tell about all the pros and cons, but why, if tens of thousands of people have done it before me. Yes, and it would not be a completely objective review, because Skyrim is my love forever, I would just praise it and that's it. Well, in general, so that you know: Skyrim is like Russia: moving from, for example, Markart to Winterhold, is the same as flying from Sochi to Murmansk. Skyrim is like the USSR: the country is divided into several regions, each with its own rules and people with different values, and so on. (I hate to sound like a racist, but in every region the creatures look different). Skyrim is like the Lord of the Rings: the orcs are still bad, no matter what they did (Well, Windhelm is an exception, the Dunmer are hated there). Skyrim is like MINECRAFT: also my love and life, only the world is not in cubes. Skyrim is FUS RO DAH !!! 100000/100 ",1,0

The games do not differ much, the price is the same. WWP Remastered only has an improved screen resolution and achievements.

"To be honest, I don't know what to write in the review, but I just want to say a few words. This is one of my first long visual novels I read. (before that there were Zero Escape and Danganronpa - they can be called novels to some extent). The games above kept me on my toes throughout the gameplay (if you can call it gameplay), and Chaos; Child is no exception. Strange murders in Shibuya, investigations, Gigalomaniacs (espers in my understanding) are interesting to watch. But it's just as interesting to watch our protagonist grow. From a schoolboy who doesn't care about everyone, ""if only they don't talk to me, damn wrong-siders"", at the end we can observe a guy who, it turns out, has feelings, he is not indifferent to his family (children from an orphanage, who live in a hostel). Alas, the realization of all this came at critical moments when it was not possible to fix something. Yes, I will remember Takuru for a long time. For me, this is an unconventional character. I am sure that I am wrong, and others will say otherwise. Other characters are also interesting in their own way. The stories of each of them can be found in their root. I especially remember: Serika, Hinamura, Yuki, Nono Honestly, I wanted to write a review after watching the anime adaptation, but could not resist. Although I haven't watched the anime to the end, I can say: if you are interested in the Chaos universe, go read the novel. In general, the novel left behind a lot of emotions and a reason to think about some things. I recommend to review. (Songs of Ito Kanako - one love <3) ",1,0

Ok ive now put enough houres in to this game to say that it is now my fav WW2 FPS game. I played it in EA and at that point i could already see how great the game would become. I love the historical accuracy and the maps are awsome (well most of them) and detailed. The gameplay is great especially if you like shooters that are a bit more tactical than your basic COD and BF. If youre looking for customization you wont find the best customization but it is still fun to collect the units (Skins for your soldiers that can have benefits such as camoflage) and if you love to grind for stuff there is the gun wraps and skins  BTW the wraps are the most worth it. But overall a great game and you will deffinently get addicted to it. ,1,0

"Don't be fooled by the deadline. I play the game ps vitada and am almost halfway. I played the game for 24 hours. Trails in Sky is actually a trilogy. This game is called ""first chapter"" shortly as ""fc"". Then, after the second chapter, the third chapter comes. Even if I don't know wrong, there is a save transfer event. Isn't it interesting? A jrpg and save export. You can also deduce that you have to play this series in turn. There is only a situation like this. The ""trails"" series does not end when the 3rd chapter ends. The trails in sky trilogy ends. It still has Cold Steel Azure & Zeros. Therefore, if you are going to start the series, I suggest you go in the following order. I will do that. FC -> SC -> 3rd -> Zero -> Azure -> CSI -> CSII -> CSIII -> CSIV CS by Cold Steel. Let's get to the game after giving this information. Trails in Sky is a classic turn-based jrpg that debuted in 2004. The order advancing from top to bottom on the left of the screen shows who has the attack order. It happens that he sometimes writes critical, ep 50%, cp 10% besides the person or enemy whose turn it is. These are simply bonuses. There is no random encounter in the game. Even this is a plus in itself. Our main character Estelle receives a surprising gift from her father at the beginning of the game. Of course, what kind of gift is this for his father? Estelle also wants to be ""Bracer"". Bracer money problem solver. We can say that it is a kind of mercenary. In order to be a bracer, it is necessary to pass written practical exams at various stages. The game does not force you in this regard. It doesn't even force it at all. After a little mission, you get bracer. He progresses more on this in the game. You can take various missions from bulletin boards in bracer guilds or go directly to the main scenario. My advice is to do these tasks as much as possible. Small missions, mostly guild missions, such as killing creatures, escorting or finding something lost. Of course, not all of them are like that. They have different missions among them. You may think, ""I will move forward in the main scenario, and do these tasks towards the end of the game"". Unfortunately, the game does not offer you such an opportunity. These are the missions that are canceled after a certain stage. You may go to the bulletin board and see an expired text next to an advertisement that you have never seen. If you want to avoid money problems, you should do these tasks. Do not worry, there are not many of these tasks. In the prologue part, there were 8 or 10 or so. I stated above that the game is turn-based. What you need to be careful about here is to hit the enemy as unnoticed as possible. Thus, you will both earn the right to hit the first hit and get double exp bonus. The opposite can be really troublesome sometimes. Based on the amount of time I've played so far, I can say that you shouldn't spend too much time with enemies. Just fight once to add to the monster notebook if you encounter a new enemy, and when you look at the enemy by saying details during the fight? analyze if any. We can compare the system of the game to the Material system of Final Fantasy 7. Similar logic but slightly different and more detailed. Already the game gives a tutorial about it. The system works as follows; As you kill the enemy, various orbs fall from these enemies. You go to the shops called Orbal Factory and open slots thanks to these orbs and you throw various skills there such as attack 2, hp 1 etc. Or, using these orbs, you can create skills such as defense 1, hp 2, and then assign them to the slots you open. You can also monetize these orbs if you want, but I wouldn't recommend. Don't do it unless you're stuck with a lot of money. To talk about the characters, our main character Estelle Bright is a tsundere. He approaches events more emotionally than logical. Her half-brother Joshua is the opposite of Estelle. But I have to point out that it's about Joshua. Estelle's father and Joshuan don't have any blood ties. (If the game reverses about this in the future, it is a separate issue, which is not mentioned in the review) Speaking of Estelle's father, it would not be if we don't mention him. Caius Bright. Living legend in the game. You will hear a lot of different characters in the game that are very powerful, incredibly talented, literally the definition of perfection. Even our teacher in the Bracer guild is a student of Caius. Almost every character in the game has a personality. Some people like to fish, some are watching the stars and dreaming at night, others try to get what they want by using their position, etc. etc. So talk to anyone you can talk to. They can also give you good tips. At the beginning of the review, I mentioned that I played the game vitada. The reason for this is entirely due to the voiceover. And the voiceover is really good. Let me give you good news, they have adapted it to PC. With a little research, you can find it. I have to mention that I haven't tried it. For the part I've played so far, my score to the game is 87. I guess that it will get a close score when the game is over, looking at the course of the game. ",1,0

"It is gratifying to find pearls where I did not expect too much; I want to pay tribute to the novel, it coped with its task remarkably - pleasantly while away a cool winter evening for me. It should be added that the Christmas mood contributes a lot to the goals described; while all this atmosphere still hovers in the air, there is a Christmas tree, garlands in the room, you finish the remnants of salads from the 31st and eat them with new ones, cut for mom's birthday. A very touching, unhurried story about the misadventures of a twelve-year-old girl, Ethany; difficulty of choice: me or family, my life or the life of other people, struggle or humility. I liked all the endings without exception, every time it was a little different from what I expected from the very beginning - and this is wonderful. There are absolutely adult thoughts, there is a childish, naive belief that tomorrow will definitely be better, there is a funny humor spiced with characteristic chibi-art. The aftertaste from the passage remains sweetish; It’s like I’ve read a little story, with an open ending - but here you can decide on your own how open it will be (and whether it will be at all, or it will all end without really starting). Laura grains, and it's a pity, the story with the Lighthouses and Rangers has great potential, and surely in this world many more plots could be thought up - but we are already shown several views of everything that happens, and the characters are mostly curious, behind a rare (and subjective ) exception. Being able to perceive miracles and having an interest in the concept of appropriate sacrifice - no doubt; you have to dive, but not very deep. ",1,0
"""The Book of Unwritten Tales: Die Vieh Chroniken"" is a classic point & click adventure and tells the story. Here you will get to know two characters you already know from the first game. The adventurer Nathaniel ""Nate"" Bonnet and the mysterious cattle. Nate is on the run again from the bounty hunter Ma'Zaz. This time the cat & mouse game takes you to the icy northern lands and to Seefels. Some strange characters will cross your path again. You control up to two characters alternately and apart from the space bar you only need the mouse for help. Visually, the game lags a bit behind the first, even if the last third shows a lot. The puzzles are partly (too) crisp and there are again many funny allusions to all sorts of familiar things. The German voice output is first class, I found the background sound to be very pleasant. Main story: 7-10h replay value due to two different levels of difficulty (normal & difficult). Difficult makes the puzzles even more ""tough"". Apart from the achievements, there is no optional content or microtransactions. Too much room for swipes at the PETA organization. Funny in the beginning, annoying over time. This part felt a lot less charm and variety than the first game and I had to laugh a lot less often. Some of the puzzles were too much trial & error for me. It gave me too few hints, even on the normal level of difficulty, which sometimes did not motivate me to continue playing. A fun puzzle adventure with weird characters, a little too much trial & error and too little variety. ►► ►► ⸻⸻ The game was played in a resolution of 5120 x 2880 (DSR) on the following system: ⸻⸻ 👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu curator group in German / English 👑 ⠀⠀⠀ and discover more reviews from me 🎊 Cheers, Fletcher ",1,0

"Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the original comic, so I can't say how exactly the characters of the game correspond to the original source. But what can I assure you - Blacksad: Under the Skin really Murders, scandals, intrigues, excuses - here you will find everything you need for a fascinating story. Moreover, the player is not a simple observer of developments. You will have to look for evidence yourself, find a connection between them and draw the appropriate conclusions. The game has a special screen, which is somewhat reminiscent of the ""web of evidence"" from Sherlock Holmes. In this mode, you will compare the facts and calculate the suspects. And even if you do not understand or miss something, the hero of the game, the cat Blacksad, carefully writes down all the observations and conclusions in a notebook, which can always be opened and guessed at one time or another. Therefore, you will never lose the thread of investigation, as is often the case in film detectives. The only thing that can overshadow the impression of the game adaptation of Blacksad - a weak technical side. Some scenes have a horrible frame rate, the character interacts clumsily with the walls, so walking in narrow places turns into a stream of curses, sometimes a black screen appears after loading, and so on. However, the dynamics of the plot almost smooths out all the shortcomings. More than once you will be sure that you have found the killer, but thanks to his keen eyesight, sense of smell and hearing, Blackhead will always throw in new evidence and the chase for the real criminal will continue! If you like detective stories - take Blacksad: Under the Skin without thinking. ",1,0

"It is night when Yaya Haku, an old Qüido (I would say they are jellyfish people), is out in her boat and a ship explodes very close to her. She heads for the burning wreck and finds a basket with a baby in the rubble. The little koa. Since nobody else has survived this misfortune, Yaya takes the girl to her island and raises her. But time moves on relentlessly and things change ... At this point I would like to point out that you can play the prologue of the game as a demo. It includes the beginning and tutorial described above and gives a good first impression of the game's gameplay. You can find the link to the demo below in my conclusion. Chibig, developer and publisher, is already known to me through mobile games and has already shown at Deiland, to which I unfortunately cannot link a review, that a mobile game can also be ported and adapted well to the PC. Summer in Mara is a beautifully viewable single player title. You slip into the role of Koa, the little girl that Yaya Haku fished out of the sea, and head for an adventure. The island of Yaya wants to be cultivated; Felled trees are replaced by newly planted seeds, fruits are harvested and fields are tilled. You can also go fishing and mine ore on the island. Of course you can do some of the activities on other islands; yes, you can set sail too. The ability to go out to sea you unlock in the course of the story. This enables you to travel to new islands, meet new people and also find new components to build. You can also learn new recipes and improve your equipment. With what you cook in your home, most of all, you regain endurance and fill your stomach. But what happens when you are starving, I haven't found out yet, I've always fed Koa nicely. In order to cook, you need, of course, ingredients that you can either grow, harvest in the wild or buy from vendors. You can also make multiple items in your kitchen at once, as long as you have the necessary ingredients. But your home is not only used for cooking, you also have a workshop and can build certain things outside of your own four walls. For example, a new well next to your fields, so you can not only irrigate your fields and shorten the ripening time, but also increase the limit of the tree population on your island. And you will need the space, either because you need a lot of wood or because you bring a lot of new fruits from your travels and want to plant them on your island. The last important function of your home is sleeping. You can also spend the night on your boat, but that doesn't bring back as much stamina as a night in your own bed, not rocked by the sea. Unfortunately the characters are not synchronized, only an occasional ""Ah!"" or something like that, sometimes laughing too. Otherwise, the game is accompanied by good background music that accompanies you in the game. Islands and characters are pretty, colorful and individually designed. In the conversations, the drawn portraits of the characters are displayed and also change facial expressions according to the situation. Summer in Mara is a nice title. If you want a relaxed adventure with farm elements, I don't think anything wrong here. The best thing to do is to download it and take a look at Koa's world for yourself. This product was made available by the developer / publisher for review purposes. ",1,0

"I will say from myself - ""I am delighted with the game!"" Amazing graphics, thanks to Cryengine! Excellent optimization, all crybabies with buckets of bolts - go forest! Buy a 1080 Ti, a normal gaming computer for £ 200,000. and then we'll see how you complain about the optimization !!! And then they sit on ancient computers and yapping, ugh at you, abomination. So, and now on the case, when all the scum that was all over the place. Beautiful setting, location and timing is perfect for this game. Interesting replayable gameplay, thanks to the permanent death of characters. Fortunately, the progress of the account remains monolithic. We introduced a system for pumping a character, talents, HP, gradually opening guns and attachments for your account and your fighter in particular. What Crytek has always been famous for is its attention to detail! These are the most beautiful zombies since L4D2! Thanks guys, the eye is not happy! I've been waiting for this game for over 4 years. I waited and took part in the alpha test. To the screech of a pig, he rejoiced at every victory. The shooting system has a bias towards realism, except that there is no ballistics, as in BF3. And so, a fairly high entry threshold. Play solo and party with a friend. In a sense, PvE & PvP. There are many options for passing the mission, the game forces you to be flexible if you want to win. The best zombie hunting simulator of recent years! The game is worth its money to the penny. They asked a little more, the game will expand, there will be about 15 bosses. As for the map, I won't say for sure, I don't know if there will be other maps. I bought it as soon as I received a notification by email, Hunt is available on Steam! In conclusion, I want to say, thanks to everyone who worked on this game! Good luck and success in the future, we are with you! I invite you guys to plunge into the world of treacherous hunters, disgusting creatures and damned swamps of Louisiana ... ",1,1
"That's why they press so badly * This one is a bit spoiled * is to say that the legend of frank west is closed, which has been in fact since the old part. Another thing is that the game likes to hold. And often freezes It is slippery than the previous part (Part 3), that might be right. But your brother's game freezes, what do you do? Sign out for the system to work again. But normal people will turn off the computer But this method does not cause the computer to crash quickly Moreover, the game has nothing to remember. There is nothing like eye catching, but asking if I'm satisfied. You get more than every sector, but it is, shadow wariou2 is even better. Yeah. I want to say that when playing crack, the problem is free. Is the end of the playoff game I can only feel one thing: buy it to pay for the sins that I used to play illegal. But don't say so It might be right there. But most of them try to buy it, hoping to play it again, but find that the same stage, running to the goal, the game is not over, openworld is the end, that is understood, but cut off the co-op, leaving only multi is the game I do multi. Yeah, good idea. I think there must be part 5 and he will definitely improve it better. And believe that voting yes Not a good game But it was already numb to satisfaction And want to have it again In the same format as the original sector or openworld, it is still good, with a lot more additional missions, haha, support it, the game is almost good, but if there is part 3, then it is similar. Change to a snow town by myself. The game is not bad. ",1,0

"And if they are also excellent, then in general there is no price for them :) Take Fighting + Classic 2D + Anime Style we get BLADE ARCUS from Shining: Battle Arena So what we get in this game: 1) Excellent graphic style (anime style) and portrayal 2) Simple, but attractive gameplay 3) Easy entry into control 4) Attractive characters (heroes and heroines) 5) Excellent voice acting of characters. 6) The sounds are good. 7) 16 characters (each has its own story mod) 8) Online mode (regular and ranked matches) It's a pity that online is empty, but you can play with friends from steam. 9) Some of the easiest achievements (there are 19 of them in total. One for the beginning of the battle. 16 for passing the story of the mod for each fighter. Next comes the achievement, you played for all Persians. Closing achievement, for getting all the achievements). I recommend the game for fans of the genre. And the rest - at its discretion. Play only good games :) ",1,0
"was released in   for PC by   (however, it was previously released in Q4 2009 for PS3/X360). Back when I first played it, I didn't know what to expect mainly because the first Assassin's Creed game was interesting, but very poorly executed, but since the media was giving so much praise, why not try it? What I found was one of what I consider the best games of the previous generation. Let's begin talking about the technical part -  . The game  , and in scenes with lots of NPCs and things happening, I could feel that the game was running   (of course I will let my PC specs later to give an idea), and I can't say that the graphics still good, they're acceptable, but most of time, if you take a more close look you will see that a lot of textures are in low resolution. Anyway, the game offer options to customize the graphics if you're running in a not so powerful machine, and from what I remember, it scalate pretty well in older systems.  .  Now, about the story. It will be hard, but let me try do it in the more fast and understandable way: Back in the crusades, there was two factions fighting, the Assassin's and the Templars. Assassin's wanted to achieve peace for the mankind by giving people freedom, while templars wanted to control people with extremely powerful artifacts of an ancient civilization, because for them it was the only way to achieve peace and a perfect world. Things happened between that time and now (2010 - 2011), and those artifacts are now lost. However, a corporation called  , that is controlled by Templars discovered a method to find those artifacts -  , and so, they developed  , a machine who could  . And then, they captured  , an Assassin that had escaped from his family and was living without any connection with them as a bartender. Things happened, we now retrieved his memories from Altair, an edgy assassin that was the main character of the first game and now, because of those things that happened, we're going to retrieve another guy past, but this time is not only for the info on the artifacts, but also to train Desmond -  . Anyway, during the game, we will not follow much of Desmond story, so we are going to now talk about it's ancestor that is also my favorite character in the entire series.  was a young italian guy from 15th century, doing young italian guy things, he had a happy family, two brothers, a father and mother, and one sister, but then pretty bad things happen and he need to get away from his house and city with his sister and mother, so he run away to  , and his plan was to stay there for sometime and then go away from all that. However, some other things happen, and he decide to help his uncle to fight against some bad guys. And then for some motive he decides to stay there with his family,  . Then he go and begin to hunt down who made the bad things that made him run away in first place, and then he enter in the Assassin order, discover that his true enemy is now the Pope, and go hunt him too. Not in this exact order. Now, talking about the gameplay. During your gameplay, you will expend most of your time on Animus, since it's the main part of the game.  . Initially, you will have open access of the parts of those cities that you have unlocked so far, and you unlock more parts of the cities doing story missions, but in free mode you can go search for treasures, do side missions or just explore the cities. You also have money  , however, the most powerful armor can be only adquired doing side missions, where you search for things to unlock Altair armor, in those side quests, you need to use your skills to go up in places, sometimes with a time limit, they're like puzzles based on skill. I didn't have much problems other than controls, and even then I didn't have to try more than 3 times to get at some place, other side missions include  . You also will have some collectibles like   and some Animus bugs left by the last guy who they used the machine.  ,  . This all I need to say about it, I think. Control wise,  , and I played with a keyboard and mouse setup. Playing with this may give you some problems to get up in some places or do some more advanced parkour, but it's not too bad. The combat is also fluid, but it kinda get repetitive in late game, unless you decide to be creative and use the entire arsenal that Ezio have -   and things like it. You don't need to, but it's cool and add some diversity than just kill people with swords. Now, about it's soundtrack, there's not much to say,  . Composed by  , it just add so much to the game, like   while someone is pursuing you. It's so good. So, this is it. The Ezio story will go on in the two following games, Brotherhood and Revelations, and in a short movie that tell what happened with him after those two.   8.0/10 ",1,0
"One of the best games in this genre. The plot, Russian localization, skill leveling, BBPU, and new mechanics have also been brought to the DLS!

Overall I will give it an 8/10 wish it was a tad longer but I understand. Hopefully there will be more games in the future ",1,0

"Very good RPG with races and you must know I like car races. Things I liked a lot : 1 - The quests are fun to do, we have to explore and it's very well done. 2 - I liked the combat system, it's fun but some may not like the charcter view. 3 - The fact that I can drive cars and be able to ""teleport"" if I need is very cool. 4 - I like to race and there is a lot of races outside the main quest. 5 - It's a Mad Max Race so very cool to be able to destroy other cars while moving. 6 - Steam achievements are fun to do. 7 - It's a game where you upgrade your shtuff to become stronger, your car / your character and you will have to fight for it. Note I had problems doing 2 achievements and watching YouTube videos helped me. (seems not to be the same on PC) Message to Devs > I would like to have more games like this :) P.S. I forgot to specify: It got a screenshot editor to take cool action shot on pause and be able to move the camera and adding nice effects before taking your shot. ",1,0

"Awesome! Incredibly awesome. A great expansion of the great game. I passed Frostpunk on Extreme about an year ago and was extremely satisfying. I was kinda busy at work, so I installed it only at this Friday Night and.... I played whole, really whole weekend. Finally I passed the game after 18 hours of playing and about 5 huge restarts (by huge I mean, I reached day 15+ and started over). Actually, am basically sleeping. I only wrote pros and cons. Short review, if you liked original campaign - you should like this DLC Pros - Gameplay is changed a lot with original game. It is another and it is good - I really liked playing autumn scenario. When winter came it was a nice psychological attack. - Main mechanics of building generator is very great. - A lot of new stuff: docs, fishing, factories and etc... - A lot of choices. Choices really matter. - There are 2 huge tech tree. They change gameplay even more - The game on extreme was really extreme (but it fulfilled my hardcore wishes) Cons - Some events are strictly triggered, so you can easily avoid them on replayings. - I am pretty sure it is impossible to pass the game perfectly with Extended Shifts (instead of Double shifts). All other options don't game so significantly. Maybe it is the reason I restarted so much :D I recommend this DLC even for a double price. It is a great DLC for nest strategy game (in my opinion) of 2018 year. ",1,0

"""Slashing Demons"" is a little-known game in the eyes of domestic players. It is a game where the protagonist uses modern weapons to hunt down magical creatures, but he has great historical value! Game introduction: ""Slashing Demons"" ""Slayer"", also known as ""Fear Killer"", was produced in 2004. At that time, it was not only selected as a competition item by many competitive competitions, but also won numerous awards. The game supports special effects such as BLOOM, and the HAVOK physics engine used makes the overall picture performance of the game more reasonable! Of course, the optimization of the game is very close to the people, and a low-end computer like me can also get a perfect gaming experience! However, continue What I want to show you next is his re-enacted version: ""The Curse of Hell"". This game will be built with the ""Unreal 3"" engine, and the picture quality has been greatly improved, while inheriting the fast-paced game core of the original. The network cooperation mode, deathmatch mode and team deathmatch mode have also been added to the basis of the original work, making it the essential change from the one-player battle to the multiplayer competition! Screen: 8.5 points compared to the 2004 black box version, In the 12-year remake, it is not difficult to see that the overall picture is closer to the game's Gothic background in content, and it can be seen in the details that it retains a lot of the weapon strikes in the original work, and the tragic effect of various monster deaths. , Modeling has also been upgraded from a single wave to finely carved. Therefore, it is very conscientious to say that this remake is on the screen, don't miss the picture party! Sound & Music: The sound effects of the 8.0-point game are basically intact. The black box version of the sound effect package is added to the re-engraved version. Interpretation of the original meaning of ever-changing inseparable from its ancestry. Including the protagonist Daniel's breathlessness when he was injured, the puff of the enemy when he came out, and the choir style node that prompts you to enter the next scene every time you reach the bottom of the game, and even the exciting BGM during the battle. These alone can evoke the feelings of reluctance in the hearts of old players! Gameplay: 7.0 points Although the improvement of the screen gives people a brand-new feeling, the sound effect retention can recall the past. However, in the ""Curse of Hell"", quite good levels have been deleted, such as the ""bunkers"" and ""Leningrad"" that can be used in the chaotic and crazy military world, and the battles in the sewers and bridges. Huge new winter towns and other classic levels. Of course, that was only when the game itself was first released, and it can now be experienced by purchasing DLC. In general, if not counted as DLC levels, the level will be cleared in less than 6 hours. The game time is really so long that the player has not killed the monsters to the extent that it hastily ended. Game content: 9.0 points The game tells the story of Daniel being trapped between heaven and hell, and his trial moment is about to come. Hell is the verge of evil war, and he is a pawn in hell. After the battle, he would have left Purgatory and Hell to be reunited with his wife Catherine, but Daniel was angry and lost his mind. He insisted on choosing revenge, which was a path of no return. And the source of all this is attributed to Daniel Samael, the only heaven connector. It was he who made Daniel a ""fear killer""! Take the weapon of heaven, drink the potion of transforming into a demon, and carry the map transfer board of the different world between heaven and hell to kill Lucifer's hell soldier's intentions and heaven's wife again See you! Therefore, players who like Gothic religious stories will have great love for this game. Overall rating: 8.1 points Eight years later, the picture quality has been upgraded. The content remains the same, which is remarkable. What is missing, I know well. If you want to pass on, don't fried rice. Finally, what everyone needs to pay attention to is: if you want to enter a game, first see if this game is suitable for you, don't just use the first impression and just give it in without thinking! Second, don't You can judge the quality of the game when you see the bad reviews or good reviews on any player or media website! After all, each of us has subjective thoughts when commenting, we must trust our own hearts before making a decision! Third, if You have a lot of capital reserves, the above can be ignored, but you can't blindly, because the game is also a product that meets the spiritual needs of humans. The process is important, but in the end it is still an illusory dream! ",1,0
"GAME Well that, great game, one of the best things that came out in 2019, if it was rightly so that it won the GOTY, the gameplay is very good, quite fast and you will always need time to practice and get used to it, since the game is based on the parrys and dodge, not so much in the damage you do to your enemies, but in the posture and blocking at the precise moment, learning the right moment in which you should dodge or block, and learning how to use the Mikiri counterattack will be very important too, But the satisfaction when you manage to finish off a Boss who was costing you is unmatched, don't give up, no matter how difficult it may seem at first, nothing is impossible. The story to find out everything you will have to read the descriptions of the objects and the memories of the bosses, do not forget to explore a lot, you can find things that will facilitate the fights later. Play it, it's well worth it, and personally I didn't find it as difficult as Dark Souls. Do not forget. To doubt is to fail ",1,0

"Sex doesn't exist. As a female, I just can't hide the truth anymore! Have you ever had sex? No? Well, theres no need to be ashamed. Because there is no such thing as sex as it is impossible. You see, girls actually don't have vaginas. We just pretend we do so we can promise to males something of great pleasure when we can't and won't even give it. ""Oh but what about porn where people have sex?"" you say? Well, its just carefully edited cgi as such activities are impossible with the human body. And your friends? They are just lying to look cool. Oh but where do babies come from? Space. No, hear me out. When an asteroid crashed into the earth millions of years ago, ending the dinosaur age, we, as illegal aliens landed on earth. The viruses we brough killed off all our predators and enabled us to live the perfect life. And when we proved we were living a stable life in the form of a ""family"" we were sent a baby from out home world as a gift. I know its very hard to take in.

A different choice of weapons, tasks of survival against crowds of walking cubes that will run into a crowd and will not let you go. This is the weapon of choice: Firearms? What do you prefer Shotgun or Dueling pistol? Please. Do you want to knock their brains out with a truncheon or a pipe? Yes, everything will be, but you have to get it. Chop cubes into small pieces? Which do you prefer Katana or Machete? Take and rejoice. There are also difficulties to the usual walking cubes to large bosses, you spend hundreds of hits on them, but they cut you with one blow. And the abilities that accumulate for kills simply cannot be said in one word, against bosses there will be just an ideal weapon. And yet the game is an ideal standard. ",1,1
"Description: This time my taste was a game like The Plan. The Plan is a five-minute toy that is striking in its depth. You have to play as a fly, which is carefree and defenseless in our world. The game contains a very deep meaning about the existence of life on earth. Very, very soulful music in this game, which helps to plunge into the atmosphere of calmness and carelessness. The drawing of the game is also decent. The gameplay is inherent in the game, and the plot is only for those who are deeply immersed in its atmosphere during the game. In my opinion, this is the shortest, but rather deeply penetrating game. It helps to go deep into oneself, and think about many things like: Why does a person need life? How would I live if I was a fly or some other living being? Of course, 10 out of 10. Gameplay: 10 Graphics: 10 Music and sounds: 10 Plot: 10 Overall rating: 10 I personally expressed my opinion, if you think otherwise, you can comment on this review :) I recommend to all people who are not indifferent to fate flies; D I am very grateful to Krillbite Studio, which in our time has not forgotten about such living creatures as flies! The game is masterpiece! Price: The game is free so that you can easily replay it 20 times for sure :) Yes, after the first playthrough there is an easter egg in the game in the form of a new character; Find out for yourself when you play this masterpiece! Well, thanks to everyone who read this review. See you in the next reviews xD ",1,0

"At first I didn't think I would play this game. But when I saw various updates and news, DLC Sachi (DLC4) + Deluxe Sale Edition Therefore arranged to try and play After playing, I found that the game was a lot more fun than expected. In the game, we can create a character that likes our own and AI friends. There are several guns to choose from, plus we can use a sword and a bullet-proof gun like in the anime. If talking about the characters in the game I must say that all characters are fully prepared. There are also characters from Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online. As for playing online this game, finding rooms is easy to find and this online game is not deserted. There are still people coming to set up a room to play continuously, or to set up a play room by themselves, waiting for people to come in. If you encounter a high level player, brutal items, you may get a good + good item to collect level +. Personally, when I play, when I can play online, I find a room until level 150+ and come to play the story switch online - who will help pavel the boss DLC.

"'Simple' is what I felt when I first saw this game. When I only saw the in-play video I saw in the store, it felt like a mobile game. However, when I played it myself, it was a simple game with a control element that was contrary to the mobile game. I played with the keyboard and the pad, but it felt more fun when playing with the pad. (For reference, I generally prefer keyboard+mouse play rather than pad play when playing games.) While it was fun to play in terms of control and graphics, there were some disappointing points. 1. The operation on the main screen is a little inconvenient. In general, the B button on the pad goes back, but in the setting screen, you cannot go to the home screen with the B key, and you can only go to the home screen by pressing the home button. I think that in the future, developers will continue to improve as they receive feedback from users. 2. There are no level levels. When I first encountered the game, I thought it was a level-clearing game that moves to the next level by clearing a stage like Angry Birds and other games. However, no matter how many bosses you break, once you die or play the game again after the game is over, you will start again in the green village. I'm not sure if the developer intended this point, but since there is no level system, there is no desire to clear something more. Like Angry Birds, whenever you clear a level (clear the boss), it would be nice if you were given the option to move to the next level and select a level after selecting a character. This game consists of a total of 9 keys that use four types of skills for the directional control keys, and the keys to acquire items that appear when clearing a room. As you can see from the character, it is a cute game with a simple design as well as a sense of operation. However, if you check the contents, it makes you think that you are playing a shooting game like a barrage game. Gamers who are tired of pursuing only more realistic graphics due to the advancement of modern technology will think about taking a small break while playing these cute games. ",1,0

"I probably replay the game every 10 times. Played even before the release of Steam. An unambiguous recommendation for purchase, the remake is possibly the best in the history of the game industry. This attention to detail is the same level as Valve. The only negative is poor optimization. In open spaces at maximum settings, the FPS level drops to a catastrophic 15 frames. Honestly, in this moment I was disappointed. ",1,1

If they hadn't given it to me for free, I was buying it. I love retro and the hook was because I did not know that this game was until I played it and did a little research to do this analysis, so it has more value for the surprise factor.

"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 6 years old when I heard my mother say to him, ""If you want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" I had never seen my grandfather cry before, he realized how much he had to lose if he continued to smoke. He threw the cigarette he was smoking on the floor and said he would never smoke again and tried very hard to keep that promise, unfortunately, three years later he died of lung cancer. It was very sad and it really destroyed me inside. My mother has since been telling me: '' Never smoke. Please don't let your family go through the same sadness that your grandfather put us through. '' I agreed and promised myself never to smoke. At 22, even after many temptations, I never touched a cigarette. I must admit that I deeply regret this, because this game gave me cancer anyway ..: ((( ",1,0

"Beautiful and varied. This time I'll do without any introduction and get straight to the point. The most important thing is a rouge-like game, or ""roguelike"" to put it simply. From here comes the generation of levels and a certain difficulty. Right from the start, the game explains why it is actually a roguelike. This is great because you are often presented with a fact. Well yes, levels are generated, live with it now. But this is not the case here. Level generation is intertwined (nicely, by the way) with story retelling. The message of the game is precisely that with each retelling of a story, it changes slightly. In the game, we are offered to play as one of 7 characters, each with its own characteristics and fighting style. True, initially only 4 of them were open. Others you will discover during the game. There is also online and local co-op for four. You can embellish your character, give him a name (by which the NPC will contact you), change the color of clothes and change the costume if you have opened it. The action is enjoyable and the controls are responsive. The entry-level game reminded me of Hyper Light Drifter, so if you liked it, you'll love this game too. Again, if we take the very first class as an example, that is, ordinary strikes (add up to a combo), knocking back an area strike and jumping to the side. Because this is a roguelike, without variability here anywhere. But the game goes beyond platitudes like different location of locations, etc. As the game progresses, you will come across NPCs and places to interact with. Depending on the decisions that you make or the answers in the dialogues, you slightly change the story and get certain bonuses to the character's stats. So there is pumping here as well. You can also pump your character by cooking different food (mix the ingredients that you find, only 104 options) during a halt, or by buying improvements from a merchant (you will need currency that falls from mobs / destructible objects). We also have almost complete freedom of movement. Almost, because we only have 5 days to prepare, and visiting one location takes one day. Death at the location ends the day and you find yourself in the camp. If you have passed the entire location, then several lines will be written in the history of your hero. After the end of the game, you can read the whole story, and it looks like some kind of giving. There are more than 5 locations, but some will become inaccessible as time goes on. In the camp itself, you also have a choice of what to do. Sleep, cook, watch the stars, go hunting or guard the camp. All this also entails a choice. We decided to look at the stars and saw the constellation of the rabbit in the sky? The game will ask you what you think of him and, depending on the answer, will also give some bonuses. I know, I probably should have started with the visual part, but nevertheless. In principle, there is nothing special to say here, this is just a beautiful game with pixel graphics. The colors are well chosen and nothing hurts the eyes. Nice music plays in the background, and sometimes you hear very beautiful tunes in the style of some old folk songs. Everything that was not included in the previous paragraphs will be here. Such a heap is small. 1) The game has Russian localization (but in the main menu, for some reason, someone speaks English) 2) The game has high replay value, passed with such and such a history, at the end of the game, it will tell you that now, let's say you there will be rivers 3) You can send a report about an error directly from the pause menu 4) You have only 5 days, so you won't open all the options for the story in one run.There, probably, there should be something else, but I, most likely, I forgot something as always, so that's it. If you have any questions, then write in the comments, I will try to answer. Thank you for your attention. ",1,0

"Okay, this definetely evens out the impression from the base game. Whether they beat up their writer or applied some other method of persuasion, but he actually started to write better. The levels are still linear, but are still very well crafted with some new locations to travel through. You'll encounter new enemies, as well as old ""friends"". A honorary mention to Gluskin's arc - it was everything I wanted from the main game: the background, the lead-up, the reasoning. Even the chase game seemed a bit more than that. The ending concluded the story nicely. So, if you didn't outright dislike Outlast and felt like there could have been a bit more to it, get this dlc. It was discounted nicely in the past. In fact, I do not recommend the main game without this dlc. At all. ",1,0

"Compared to not calling an f2p game pay2win, you don't have to spend on the game. A few level steps and you get unlockable items. Getting weapons isn't hard either. The basic stuff itself is not bad, you can get fragments with them. You can collect coint on the clothes. There is a problem with the game ... the players. No matter how many times you try a good stat you get an instant kick. See, in a game, I killed the host 3-4 times and kick ... And that awful lagg. If the host has a ping of 100, the server starts to lag a lot. And so the game is unenjoyable. Basically, players fuck the game.

"Since this game is Early Access, you can't expect an AAA title of course. But it is already playable in creative mode and you can build really good things once you have made friends with the controls.

So only buy when you are really sure that you have DX 11 support. And to build, I say, you should always start a new map without structural integrity and finish your construction first and then check the integrity with the N key to make sure that everything does not collapse when you switch on the integrity. (Just as a little tip;)) There are still many bugs but it is playable. I definitely recommend it. Since this game is Early Access, you can of course do not expect a AAA title.

With a splinter in my head. Guys, go to Diamond Dogs to serve. Newcomers of the E - D rank are poured bromine into the porridge. To very young guys. They then have a dick like a sentry with a Berdan gun. And after lights out, they fuck each other in the ass. They turn off the lights and run along the platforms. Raging. Love to dress up like Paz and Mother Base to serve @ protect. And fuck each other in the ass. If you got into the FOB security - consider your days are numbered. Hand-to-hand in the morning, fisting before lunch. Arugula for lunch. After lunch, an enemy invasion. Left without supper. Fag bitches. I want to eat, but they fulton me. Fuck. When Huey got married, the soldier was herded into R&D. Closed, set on fire. And they don't know anything, they talk about animals. Silent Eel dropped his weapon. His newcomers were twisted and fucked. Why? Because he is the ""Source of Problems"". And Huey and Strangelove watch and laugh. The wife has a seizure. She fell, rolled her eyes, froth from her mouth. The wife is beautiful. She died. When Huey put it in the Mammal Pod, the soldiers fired into the air. They were also shot later. Someone screamed. Nobody give a fuck. Fuck a stake, what to do? You know the answer. If Wild Harrier is tied to the bedside table, then he is guilty. And he must be kicked. Or fuck, it already depends on the person. The movie was shown today. Fucked up. Bitches. They showed how a paramedic talks about a movie. And to the soldiers to go on guard, they will shoot each other there, whore!

The decomposed corpse of Strangelove. This is our Leninist corner. Why serve at Diamond Dogs? To avoid being attacked. Skulls. They will walk around Afghanistan, purposefully create fog. Bitches. Fagots. Rust will ruin the car, what do you say to him? He doesn't understand anything in Kikongo. And they will not be able to condemn him, he is not a citizen. Only send to Devils House and shoot there. Fagots. All fish are fagots. And Skulls. Those who do not smoke are given two sweets a day. Butterscotch. One of them is pantasemin. The other contains bromine. So guess: either the hands will stop shaking, or the riser will be fierce, even if you scratch. But most of them smoke there. How can you not light up here if you are fultonized? Fuck. If you get rid of external tasks, you can go AWOL. The main thing is not to figure it out. If they do, you will be taken to the Medical Facility in a cage with Quiet, undressed, blindfolded. There is a gag in the mouth. They sit on a wet floor and drive eggs. And they include Rebel Yell. And they fuck. Artificial limbs. Okay, at least they don't fuck. Better to fuck. Whoever has a girl waiting in civilian life is given the vaccine. The military rite is as follows. As a student initiation, only you are now sterile. With a syringe. Rusty. It will then be possible to file it into a demobilized album. And the girl still can't wait.

This is nonsense. Who lived to the Outer Heaven, the cuckoo is beaten off. and an asshole like Donald Duck. But alive. Or dead. He knows better. Miller allocates 478 GMPs per day for the rookie's meals. Fuck. Allocates half as much. Big Boss takes half. Another half are senior officers. Another half is Ocelot. and comes down to soldier 17 GMP. And eats. GMP eat, fagots. Sprinkle with biomaterials, smear with tranquilizers to get out better, and eat.

"New big AAA license from Ubisoft, Watch_Dogs has arrived! But what is it really worth? The universe of Watch_Dogs therefore takes place in Chicago, one of the cities with the highest crime rate in the United States. This is why a new revolutionary security system was installed in an experimental way: CTOS, thanks to a large number of cameras, control of telephone and urban systems, CTOS watches over the inhabitants of Chicago as “Big Brother”. But this system is not infallible and a number of hackers like you, Aiden Pierce manage to take control of it to use it as a weapon. Technically the script is complete and original, although not in depth enough. Between phone hacking, banking machine, urban system and even metro, the gameplay of Watch_Dogs is rich in possibilities, although it becomes exhausted as the game progresses. Car driving turns out to be fast and fluid, just like the handling of weapons or the hacking system. Graphically even if it is not the visual slap of the year, the game is very beautiful although a good configuration is required to play it. We also note that a number of impressive visual effects have been removed since E3 to optimize the game. Effect that we can fortunately find with the Worse Mod. Finally the biggest problem of the game remains the lifespan, indeed even if the main missions will occupy you for about thirty hours, the rest of the game is very empty. The activities are fun at first, then very repetitive to the point that there is a good chance you will stop when the campaign is over. The game is still rather replayable. Regarding the Bad Blood DLC, which tells us more about T-Bone, it turns out to be quite limited in terms of the scenario, but it compensates with a good, varied and really immersive mission package. The DLC is also the first to offer the possibility of playing missions in co-op. But is it really worth its price? Difficult to say ... For multiplayer, Watch_Dogs has tried to cut the separation between Solo and Multi by allowing for example to hack his friends while they are in play. But unfortunately the games between friends are very boring without a cooperative mission nor activity. In summary Watch_Dogs does not really have the messiah we expected but it is a very good game from Ubisoft which has already planned a sequel. Final Score: 17/20 Test by Xelion ",1,0

The FPS action is pretty darn good, though admittedly, you'll probably just find yourself using the disk as your only weapon throughout most of the game. ok, weapon balancing could be a little better. other than that, this game get FULL marks.

"I bought Arma 3 (last year on the summer sale) after watching some videos of arma 3 dayz mods that got me really exited to play the game.. I mainly bought it because i wanted to play the game but since it was a military based game, it had alot of gun spawns and it lacked that survival feel of the game. You did not have to worry a bit about your food because its really easy to find some, you had a map so you always knew where you were and the gameplay was over all easy and mostly the animations were really bad and laggy thats why i didn't like the game that much. A few months passed by and i decided to buy dayz standalone. I believe i bought it in january and at that time the game was on 0.62. I did not really care about all the reviews that i saw on steam or the complains of people about the bugs, i just wanted a good survival expirience. I opened the game, spawned in the middle of the forest not knowing where i was.. ran for a few minutes until i found some houses. found nothing and that was it for me. I did not know why but the game was really hard and didn't like it. At that time i heard about 0.63 and watched some videos about it and it did feel promising but i didn't want to get my hopes up because at that moment i felt like was was scammed. Again a few months after, summer arrived and it took some time but 0.63 was released on the experimental branch. I was happy, so i played the game and it was simply amazing. The gameplay was smoother, the survival theme and feel was there. A few bugs here and there but i didn't care even though i lost a lot of loot cause of these bugs i simply didn't care. This is the game that i asked for. I spent 20h to learn it and im still a noob but i managed to learn how to get around the map and felt amazing. This is the revival people! I strongly recommend buying this game and trying out the 0.63 or maybe save your money and wait for the full release. The devs said that there will be base building 100% on 1.0 wish i am really hiped about. Thanks for reading my story Lol ",1,1

"I must start by saying that the experience of this game is subjective, you can like and hate it regardless of what the reviews say. The idea of ​​the game is simple, but its development is complex, if you know Stanley Parable, this is the 2D equivalent. Your objective in this game is simply to unlock the 25 finals and platinize the achievements, even the game itself says so, when you complete everything you receive the achievement ""uninstall me"". If you don't like this premise of exploring possibilities and unlocking endings, you will find this game a waste of your money. About the endings, some are simple and you will unlock them soon, others are extremely complex, you have to be a deduction genius to be able to finish some using the tips hidden by the game. You can hardly finish it without looking at community guides. But the aesthetics of the game, the context and the events, are brilliant and very well done. Most of the endings are references to fiction or conspiracy theories, with allegories of Satanism and secret societies, some endings will leave you wondering what the hell that really meant, other endings are kind of boring. But, as I said, the purpose of the game is this discovery, it's the puzzles, if that doesn't interest you, your experience in that game will be bad. It is not a ♥♥♥♥ game, it is a very well made and very elaborate game, but don't expect a super production, because believe me, you won't even leave that monitor .... .... or will you? ",1,0

"A friend of mine gifted this game to me. The store description does a pretty good job of explaining the basics of this game. I love this game, most of the time. The dozens of classes make for a lot of variety and replayability, and frequent updates based on community feedback and statistics keep the game fresh. Public games start with 16 players while private games can start with as few as 8. While you can leave after you're eliminated, you should always have at least half an hour to dedicate to the game before queueing for a public match. This is because leaving the game while you're still alive is both against the rules and makes for a worse experience for the rest of the players. This is especially true if the leaver had an ""important class"". Sometimes, especially if you get a class you don't like, the game can get salty. Many times other people's logic won't make any sense to you. Sometimes their deduction isn't even based on logic and it's just a gut feeling. You will run into cases where you will disagree with other people, and that's just inevitable. Hence, I love this game ""only"" most of the time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy vast majority of the games I play, and the awesome plays are much more memorable than the salty failures. The games are often close victories, with the winning play happening near the very end of it, and those games are usually great even if you happen to be on the losing side. I've played this ~400 hours (at the time of writing this) in the last 10 months. It is one of those games I can pick up and expect to have a good time at the end of my day. With the current playerbase, the longest public matchmaking times are around 8-10 minutes, but usually I can find a game within seconds. ",1,0

"Shakes and Fidget Shakes and Fidget was originally a browser game that made its way to Steam via ""Steam Greenlight"". But the browser game also had its origin in something else. This is in the comics by Oscar Pandier (Shakes) and Marvin Clifford. The style and humor found in the former online comics can still be found in this game today. Even if the creators of the comics are no longer involved in this game, the style just mentioned is unchanged and funny. At the beginning of the game, you create a character in all MMO style. This can not only be assigned to a people and a class, but also optically designed according to all the rules of the absurd. Once this step has been taken, you can start exploring the game. Here you can first discover the city map. All fields of the game can be reached from this map. The most important areas on this map include the tavern, the city guard, the duel area and the roll of honor. From the tavern you can start your adventures, which you choose from three options and then cannot influence any further. At the end of the set adventure time, which runs in real time, you can see the outcome of your fight, collect your reward and invest or sell it. Each adventure uses up some of your 100 adventure points. If this is used up, you can hire the city guard and bridge the waiting time for the next day. But of course you can also attack other players (10 times a day). If you win against the other player, you win some gold and honor. The honor ensures that you rise on the roll of honor. If you lose, you logically descend again. With slightly higher levels of your character you unlock more and more options of the game. This includes dungeons and your own camp, which you can also expand. An important part of the game are guilds, with whom you can chat, discuss strategies and fight together. All of these factors make Shakes & Fidget a great free to play title that has only one, but one huge minus point. Almost everything in this game can be influenced by the use of mushrooms. These are very rarely found in the game itself. However, it is possible to buy for ""real"" money. While this doesn't exactly make the game unfair, it does give people with more money an edge. Conclusion: Shakes and Fidget is a game that you can run very well as a sideline and that also runs on bad or old computers / laptops. Unfortunately, after a while, you lose the motivation to play the game, as it takes a long time in later character levels. Since the game does not cost anything, a look for every fan and interested party shouldn't hurt or hurt. Sincerely, MeisterEder135 ",1,0

"I payed 14.99 for this game and i wasn't disappointed in the slightest! A heartbreaking backstory for your cat that honesty makes me want to cry is a great way to tell how good this is gonna be. There are so many options to customize your experince and make it much better than a classic game. Its like Stardew valley, with the open world and the many options for love. The art and animation is fantasic after you get used to its profiles of the other cats. The stores and the many things used as money is a nice and creative idea as well, giving you more options than the ok and the legendary sorts of things. Controls are easy to learn on computer, and this made me stop using arrow keys as much from how much i've played. One thing the community is lacking in has to be multiplayer! It would be fun to interact with other people that play this game, and it could be made where its a more entertaining version of the main mode where everyone is the charater, no quest from Coco, and real people combining skills to help increase territory, hunt, and train yourself! And what if the kickstarters where able to make servers with their own custom colonies? It would be really cool if that would be a thing, since the only replay value can come from trying to date every cat and testing things you never did. Other than that, if this could be rated in stars, i would for sure give 5/5 for a nice game! ",1,0

"I am the voice of freedom, and you are the sword of freedom. You are the people fighting for humanity. This struggle can only be victorious with your belief. (Voice of Freedom) I am not sure whether to recommend the game or not. The pros and cons are almost equal. First of all, if we touch on its story, a fear arose in the world with Korea's nuclear missile trials. Korea, as a second step, unites with South Korea and establishes the great republic of Korea. As a third step, it conquers Japan. Of course, not only that, but the island countries in the south, China begins to conquer some African countries. Then it was time for America. Half of America has been occupied and we freedom resisters have started an insurrection plan. The game continues on this story. The graphics of the game are not bad compared to the year, the gameplay is quite comfortable. But the impact and combat effects are weak. The duration of the story is very short and even where you need to jump from point to point, it does it with animation. So your in-game freedom is very limited. I want to conclude here, if you are thinking of buying the game for the single mode story, don't buy it. But if you say I have a circle of friends, we play a lot, take it. I really liked the parts of the game where we use sniper and helicopters. It is very rare that many of the games I play have a structure belonging to this theme and such an enjoyable scenario. But as I said, a script of at least 15 hours should have been made over this story. Even COD, while the series was able to take 7-8 hours to get crazy stories, this game's inability to do this seemed to me a minus. 6/10 ",1,0
"Ignore my playtime on this. I have already finished the game outside of the steam, played multiple times. The game plays just like the previous game, Max Payne1. It has bullet times and it's unique gameplay yare. Now the enemies AI have slower reaction time and won't attack as soon as you come out of corners/covers, giving you some time to shoot first and not obliterate you with swarms of people. They also added ragdoll physics in Max Payne2 unlike with Max Payne1 which only has scripted death animations. It's fun to see your enemies fly out of the air and collapse on the ground with slow motion. Just like the previous game, comic-style narrative fits the game's mood well, exceedingly much better looking than Max Payne1 also with some improvements on overall casts and soundtracks.  I think the game is pretty good although some of the game's scenes/animations were slightly rough on the edges, even felt awkward. But actions, on the other hand, it's much engaging and enjoyable than the previous game. If you like games with bullet times, none stop actions and such like the noir genre.  I'm highly recommended you play this game. ",1,0

"is a game where you can be a villain of horror movies or those who run away from it, but each character has its own characteristics that give an extra air to the game. As mentioned the game has the ones you are chasing, in total there are 4 survivors and 1 of these amazing villains, but there is the option of playing with friends and it can be at [and 1vs1 (if you are going to play like this, play as a survivor). The survivors have to flee (I know it's obvious), but what is difficult is to connect the 5 generators so that you still have to find one of the two doors and still hope not to be caught, but if they are caught, hope that the monster do not keep coffin (stay by your side until you die). At that moment they must be thinking ""but what if everyone else died and only I survive ???"" well, hope that your friends have made at least two of the generators and that luck is at your side, since if two generators are made you have the option to escape through the hatch (which will be lost in the field without signage). As most of the genre it doesn't have a storyline or it is full online all the time, so play with at least one friend and have a lot of fun, if you play alone, I hope you don't get sick quickly. , you can only really escape, because only the monster will have weapons, the most you will have is equipment to increase the speed of repairing the generator, medical kits and a flashlight to blind you.

"Although it is said to be the fairy sword series, it is estimated that it will enter the official history in the future, but currently playing two main lines does not feel so fairy sword. The nine fields of this worldview are divided into prosperous and prehistoric, according to the interviews found, it is Pangu dreamland, which is outside the six realms. The guardian of the prosperous world is the superintendent of heaven, and the hunter of the devil is the Cangshou clan... At present, the intersection with Zheng Zuo is probably that there is a fairy sword plot level to review the plot and take the main battle. I hope that there will be more intersections to expand the details of the world view. The plot of a female account looks very fragrant as a lily, the cold-faced white-haired loyal dog is the heroine of the heavenly plum, and the dubbing is also very good. When I was young, I met the prehistoric, awakened and rescued each other, and fell in love at first sight, and then half-turned the day after tomorrow, the demon descended, and killed with a sword— ""I am your siblings, your weapons, and your half-body."" The art style is really great, Full of expressiveness, currently playing two levels can only say that there are really many CGs, and the boss momentum is also sufficient. The gameplay is the traditional krypton gold card CCG. It is estimated that it will be available on all platforms in the future. I don't know if it will be interoperable. The experience feels pretty good. The characteristics or strategy are reflected in the order of stance activation. The core is to use cards to adjust the position on the field to change the attack sequence and targets, and control the flow of the battle. It is considered to have made its own characteristics. However, the card burst rate is currently quite low. The official said it is a BUG. It will be changed in the open beta. I look forward to the performance of the open beta. ",1,1

I found out about kenshi through youtubers and I found the idea of ​​an RTS RPG very interesting, So I tried it, I did not like the idea that the game did not have a story (be careful, it has lore that can be discovered through notes, but it does not have a story like skyrim or fallout) but when I started playing I realized That is what makes Kenshi a different game, you have no powers, you are not important, the world does not revolve around you, what's more, you are weak, very weak, even the weakest enemy you can find can kill you if not you have appropriate equipment or slightly increased stats. But that's the good thing about the game, starting from nothing and ending up being what you want to be. Do you want to found a city? Can you, do you want to form a team of bounty hunters? Can you do you want to be a technology hunter? Can you want to kill the leaders of each faction of the game and be the supreme leader of the continent? you can too.

"Children of Morta is a rpguelike a la Diablo RPG developed by Dead Mage studio and published by 11 bit studios. The game tells the story of the Bergson, a family of heroes who have protected Mount Morta for generations. Unlike cliché stories where a group of heroes need to save the universe, here the narrative focus is the family and the daily discussions between each member of it. This emotional appeal allows the player to create virtual bonds with each member of the family, generating greater immersion and deepening in the story. In addition, the game ends up gaining originality and diversity, since almost all members of the family are playable characters and can be used to explore the various dungeons existing in the title. It is undeniable that the game uses several inspirations from the Diablo franchise. The entire exploration is based on the famous Blizzard saga, even the altars are present, guaranteeing precious buffs at random. The big surprise is that the game manages to be the best game of the style in this generation and, for me, it manages to overcome even Diablo 3 within its limitations. Noting the fact that the game has a budget and a much smaller team, the studio's work is worthy of envy, delivering one of the best experiences of its kind in this generation. Everything works very well and dynamically, without any technical choking. The icing on the cake is the excellent location of all texts in PT-BR, showing the importance given by the publisher to the Brazilian public. In a smaller game, small glitches / bugs and technical problems are inevitable, however, this does not apply here. The company did an extremely passionate and attentive job, delivering a masterpiece both in visual, gameplay and sound design. Conclusion: Children of Morta is a supreme masterpiece. Without a doubt the brilliant RPG by Dead Mage is one of the best of its kind in the current generation. If you like the style, it is certainly a must buy. ",1,0

"Spore ... I just loved this game, I played it with a friend who showed it to me. And I flew to the center of the galaxy first than he did. : ^) Thanks to my little brother for this gift! ❤ Spore is an evolution game in which you start with the weakest cage and end with the strongest empire (but this is not certain). Here you can show your imagination. Isn't that awesome? You can make your own cage (well, like a cage, I personally called it a fish), you can create your own animal, your own equipment, even your own buildings. There are a lot of details in the editor, and there are also possibilities, so this will be enough for you for a long time. You can even distract small children, my nephews liked it. : D Galaxy exploration. The first four stages take a few hours, but you can fly in the ""Cosmos"" stage for more than a dozen hours. You will always have something to do. You can also buy the add-on to get some more fun, however, as I heard, Steam's version of this add-on lags, it may not even start at all. In general, in the review it is not possible to express everything, it is better to play it yourself. Trust me, it's worth it. Have you tried to destroy the Grox? Is it real at all? They have so many star systems, and the spaceships are pretty strong ... ",1,0

"This was a very freaky game, in the good way. It starts like a normal story, but then... It gets weird. REALLY weird. I really recommand it due to the good sides, though there are some bad sides that I think you should know before you buy. The good sides: - The horror story is really good, and gets more interesting as you play. The boring parts (mainly chapter 3) still have beautiful scenes to keep you interested. - The story is mostly not predictable, cause most of the things that happen during the game are SO weird that you couldn't guess them unless you saw screenshots/videos before playing. - The graphics are amazing, the drwaings are really good and evil, and there are a lot of great scenes. I think the design is pretty perfect, even though personally I would give up the black blurry frame that covers the whole game. - The story manages to be pretty original, which is hard to do with the idea of ""a person wakes up in the asylum"" that we have seen in many movies/games before. - If you happen to have any technical problems, the moderators in the forum are really helpful in helping you solve them. The bad sides: - The game is VERY easy to figure out, as you are being told exactly what you need to do during the whole game. The puzzles are easy as well, there are barely any chat options, and overall you can't really fail or get anything wrong in this game. You don't need to explore too much in order to find the solution to everything, and most of the game you just watch things happen like a movie, so there isn't really any challange. This game is clearly made for adults and not for kids, so I thought it would be much harder. On the bright side though, at least the story itself is good enough to still keep you interested. - There is no voice acting for the characters, which feels a bit outdated for a point and click game that was made on 2015. Most of the story feels like watching a muted movie with subtitles, which could work for other type of games, but with point and click the whole game is based on listening to the characters. I feel like the game could be 10 times better if it did have voice acting. - Taking screenshots in this game is really complicated at the moment and doesn't work at the normal way, which is very annoying, mainly because the scenes are so beautiful and creepy that it makes you wanna screenshot the whole game. - Unlike other point and click games, on this one you can't save different points of the game in order to come back to them later. The only options you have are to continue your last gameplay, start a new game (which will delete your last gameplay), and start a chapter of your choice from the beginning. This is not very comfortable, especially if you click something by mistake, or if you miss achivements. - The main character does not have enough reactions to the scary things, including things that involve her dead parents. She is like, ok with everything, or maybe a bit angry for a moment, but the only thing she really cares about is her cat. In some points at the game it's not really believable for a 10 years old girl to simply not care or react to things. - Sadly the scary and horror scenes really repeat themselves, and even though those are great scenes, they get a bit boring after a while. There are a few that will still surprise you, but most of them just repeat in different locations. Accoring to the credits, this game was mostly made by just two people, which is very impressive when you look at the result. I would sure want to check out their next game if they ever make any, though I hope they would fix the above problems if they do. ",1,0

"An MH-style game that can be seen everywhere, whether it is the production of weapons and equipment, missions, combat methods, and even mind-reading chips, it makes people feel very familiar. It is not an exaggeration to say that the game is made by following the trend, but he still In the world where the player has made his own characteristics instead of moving the whole movie and then discussing the ghosts, the object of the player is ghosts rather than dragons, and the bead system of MH corresponds to the soul system, which has a strong Japanese style as a first. A hunting game, in addition to the player's own technology, another key point is the outfit of the body. The game naturally provides a large number of weapons and armors for the player to make and use different types of weapons. The fighting methods are of course different, but in the balance It is sexually flawed. For example, Taito can provide considerable firepower output regardless of singles or team combat, and gun weapons, if they are loaded with single shots, will kill people. The part of the armor is bound to the suit in the game, and only the entire set is worn. In order to activate the equipment ability, you can only sacrifice the suit ability to match the beautiful and beautiful bulk by yourself. It is a pity that the Yuhun system, as the focus of the game, can be said to be very careless. The provision of skills is basically the responsibility of the Yuhun. In addition to providing special abilities, it is different The relationship between the souls is also intricate. It can be combined with a large number of combo skills. In this part, it is indeed a hunting game. The strength of the opponent directly affects the player's desire to challenge. If you want to experience tension in this game Exciting duel, you must go out alone, because the AI ​​teammates provided by the game are really strong and too exaggerated. Basically, even if the player hides from the side to watch the battle, they can win or even destroy all of them to show you extremely powerful teammates. Reduce the game The difficulty of this part is good and bad. It is a great boon for hard-handed players. In addition, there are not many large ghost species available for hunting in the game. Many of them are subspecies and small roadside trash fish species. It is so pitiful that people can't bear to look directly at it as a co-fighting game. It is almost a prerequisite for a happy crusade with other players. Even in 2018, people are still found to play together. Although not many, they can still be matched. To my surprise, I have heard of poor PC optimization. After I stepped into the game, there was no such problem. However, I encountered the problem that returning to the game after switching windows will cause the problem of jumping back to the desktop no matter which button is pressed. You must change the settings to change the full screen to windowed, and then change back to full screen. The other is to occasionally flash back when replacing the entire set of equipment that has been logged in. Apart from the above points, there are generally no serious problems. It can be expected that you will want to contact Most of the people who talk about ghosts may have played the monster hunter. Although the style of the monster hunter can make the player feel at ease, the time to get started is fast, but it also makes people want to ask, in addition to the theme and personality, what else is it? Eyes are bright? This is a very fun game that can be made, which can make the content more imaginative rather than adopting a conservative strategy. Evaluation should indeed be mixed, but there is no such option, so I still reluctantly give praise here. ",1,0

"I haven't played the Ori series, so my comparison could be wrong, and actually, I really don't want to compare this one to Ori, just the similarity is striking. But enough of this, let's roll forward, because what matters now is this pretty little game which has relly charming visuals and phenomenal soundtrack. All seasons can change the land, and every one of them has its own beauty. I liked how the devs implemented that into the gameplay, because this is what it's all about: the eternal change. Also, I must mention the outstanding sounds too, because suddenly I don't know when I heard such realistic sounds as the woods cracking, birds chirping, cascades falling etc. There is no fight in the game, just pleasant and lovely puzzle solving, which were rather annoying sometimes, and with all of the previous elements, the atmosphere was calming. I read some of the players were frustrated because of the lack of map, but I don't think that's a problem, the level design was nice and easy, maybe only one level was labyrinthine. And one achievement (""The Bird"") was divvy. My only disappointment was about the suggestions of the title, ""Seasons after Fall"", I expected something like an episode from the Grimm's Fairy Tales, that I will be a part of a tale which strokes my heart and tells me its message about passing, growing, and the value of life. And if you want, you can see these in the game, but the very simple story and characters are far not strong enough to unfold these conceptions. From this perspective, there was a lot more in the game. ",1,0
"I got this game for $7 and all the DLC for $6 and I just couldn't believe how great of a deal it was! The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome. The upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places! The combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain. The climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough. I really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving! ",1,0

"""Dracula Origin"" is a classic ""point and click"" adventure based on exploration, collection and combination of objects, solving puzzles, in which we will play as Van Helsing, obviously in search of the most famous vampire, with the aim of destroying him and stopping his evil plans. The game in general is nice, maybe a little slow, even if the puzzles are quite easy and only a couple of times we will get stuck too hard to solve the puzzles. In short, there are no insurmountable puzzles and this at the expense of a very short longevity: it will take an average of 10-15 hours to complete it. The advantage, however, is that we will always have clear ideas on what to do. The graphics themselves are very appreciable for an old game, the environments are very accurate and suggestive and the control system clear and simple ... too much. I do not feel like rejecting this game: at the end I can say that I enjoyed and spent a few hours with something different. I would recommend it only to fans of the genre, or to any player, as long as you can buy it at a low price. Rating: 6/10 ",1,0

"Awesome 8/10. No issues for me, seems a lot of kids need to get a job and buy a bit more than a potato to play it on for one, and maybe stop using dial up internet connections or phone tethering usually helps as well for online. I will say however the graphics could use a definite touch up along with environmental interactions such as the leaves etc on the water, when your in the water you just move straight through them like a ghost as apposed to the leaves, lillys etc moving with the flow of the water and out of your way. There's quite a few attention to detail that fall below standard for a 2018 AAA game.  As far as ""overall gameplay"" is concerned, the game is great, runs great loads of fun, weapons, loot and a ton of stuff to do you could spend 1000's of hours in this world and not get bored.    But maybe read the system requirements first before buying then leaving a negative review and looking like a dumb a$s. It is cpu thirsty game, if you don't have a beefy one you're gonna cry like the rest of the adolescents on here, you also need a good gpu, a 970 isn't gonna cut it, a 1070 you'll just get there, but realistically you're gonna need a 1080 or better.  If you don't have a beefy setup wait a bit before buying till they optimise the game and run some quality of life patches. Overall a great game 8/10. ",1,0

"An FPS game set in World War II with a strong minor feeling. I didn't know if it was because I was ruined or if a game like this existed, but I accidentally got a real package and played it. It's a story of the struggle of the rebels of World War II in the background sound that seems to be suitable for a working simulator. It is fresh and a little incongruity, but its perfection is in its own way. I felt that it was well structured, and I came to admit that it is the unique identity of this game. In addition, thanks to the company's Sniper Ghost Warrior's kill cam production, which is a company product such as hot gun percussion and destruction, and the scattered bleeding effect, the feeling of hit is awesome and the difficulty is relatively easy. The mission is a bit monotonous and cliché, but I enjoyed it so much that it would remain after all of that was offset. It feels like finding a pearl in the mud...? 8 of 10 ",1,0
"- 10-12 years ago ... I don't have access to the Internet and I have a copy CD vendor that I turn around every week. I did not even notice because it was eating inside me; I skipped the ""R"" title from the games listed alphabetically. The seller was suddenly angry: ""There is Rise of Nations, the player cannot quit!"" said. He gave me the sherbet again, according to the pulse, since he had previously sold Age of Empires with my father ... Nowadays we understand what is what. Even though I had a slight tide, I finally came to the road. Yes… I knew that 2₺ for a single CD would not make me poor; I owned the game by giving up my fruit juice and donut money. I got up at 9-10 every weekend, and after a while I started to wake up with the morning call to prayer. I sold my friends playing ball at the door many times and skipped my meals many times. As a result, I became the ""me"" we are today. I loved this sector wholeheartedly; When the time comes, I put myself, my friends and most importantly my family aside. Did I regret it? No way. Even though most of my time was spent explaining to people why I love games so much, I certainly haven't regretted it. Every step I take about the game; Every sentence I say and write is a guide from my depths. I put the ingredients, who want to buy, who want to not. Rise of Nations; It offers a gigantic journey of the ages, from primitive barracks and barns to missile silos and war tanks. It has such a strong fiction; It manages to handle all the intermediate periods, from the creation of humanity to the day it destroys itself. These periods; It manages to infuse people with one-hour games, which can take up to three or four hours depending on the skill level of your opponent. Resource problems that started with food and wood leave their place to metal and oil in the future. System; It works according to the requirements brought by the tools and equipment people produce according to their needs. According to my personal logic, I explain the RTS system as follows: ""From whichever side the wind blows, the system turns to that side."" Rise of Nations is the name of the game that Microsoft, with Age of Empires, moved the RTS genre to an interdimensional, absolutely inaccessible, and unavailable point. If only there was an imaginary system that could show my total playing time… If there were, you could see that I was dying for this game. Rise of Nations was well deservedly caught in the human race as it took up a higher technology and age system in terms of progression than Age of Empires. The futuristic theme, given from the edge of the coast at that time, managed to connect people to the Rise of Nations in many ways. At the time, GOTY was taken by many entities, including the late GameSpy, and it really closed an era and opened a new era with its gorgeous graphics. The only inconvenience, most RTS multiplayer portion of the game, at least for- Turkey also hosts lack healthy enough to play games. This problem still persists. If this problem, which has not been solved even now, had been solved from the first time we met on the internet… There would definitely be no obstacle to be the best RTS game of all time. ",1,0

"To be honest, the first impression from the game was negative: inhibited control of some kind of ""shooting dice"", which is compensated, perhaps, by the closeness of AI bosses in the form of rhombuses and triangles. In addition, it becomes impossible to do anything else on the computer after its launch - everything starts to slow down terribly, including Windows itself. But greed (by the way, Greed is one of the bosses)) for 39 wooden spent made him return to the game, and for good reason: upon closer examination, a very interesting concept and varied gameplay were revealed. As a result, I passed the game with all the additions and achievements. =) The whole game comes down to a series of boss battles (only hardcore!). At the time of the review, we have 14 doors: 8 main bosses, 3 additional and one superboss (evil itself) + 1 arena (non-stop battle for points) and 1 secret room (clicker without a battle). The number of rooms is not yet final, as the author promises to add new levels. A few words about the ""slowness"" of control and shooting. The physics of the game is peculiar, but it fully corresponds to its philosophy: to achieve success, you will have to keep in mind not only enemies, but also your ""weaknesses"". By the way, physics also applies to bosses and this can be used. The inertia of David is, figuratively speaking, his ""cross"": if you curb your passions, you will win the duel, no, you will lose. Such is the psychological training.)) Conclusion: The game is wonderful, but the implementation let us down a little. + various bosses; + own philosophy (or mythology?)); + its own physics (or psychology?)); + cards and achievements; + price; - no windowed mode (only full screen); - the profile is stored locally (play from only one computer!); - no optimization (eats up all CPU resources); - no gamepad support. Result: 4 hits in the ring from 5 throws. ",1,0

"Modern Warfare is no longer modern — though the combat and, in some ways, the action-movie story at its foundation are ageless, its level design and lack of campaign progression reveal its true age. But it's not outdated, it's classic, and the considerable effort that has gone into improving the models, textures, and effects have enhanced it enough that playing through the campaign again was rewarding. Multiplayer also benefits from the graphics upgrade, and its refreshingly old-school pace is fun and explosive in its own right. It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well. ",1,0

"I opened my first account in 2012 and since that year I have played with about 8-9 different accounts. Since I have known and played the game for so long, I installed it directly when I saw it on Steam. There may be those who complain that the game is 2d, but that's what makes the game beautiful. It is a great game for those who already know the game, and if you are just starting out, it may sound very silly and difficult at first. Be sure that you will improve as you play. ",1,0
"A common VR eroge ... but a game with valuable content for women. You can choose your favorite content from several contents and play it, all of which are free for now. Not only the situation but also the texture of the graphic is different depending on the content, so far there is only one type of content for women, which is not real but a graphic like a watercolor painting, which is a bit disappointing, there was a kiss scene, but I could see the contents of the face past the throat up of the face It was. By the way, it seems to be compatible with that kind of external controller, I don't have it, so I'm not sure.

"I love this game, the reason why I use steam. A very friendly environment where many veterans are willing to help the new ones, very nice maps, a game style very similar to the rest of the mmo but still (if you are not lazy) you can easily carry it. You have the option to sun the game up to level 50 (I recommend doing a group to finish the dungeons, it gives good equipment and it's fun), then and up to level 80, you must make groups to go up faster and not get bored. It is not very necessary to use real money, although of course, as in all mmo it gives you an extra, but also if you know how to manage and work hard, you can make a lot of money in the game without spending a penny irl. I have seen many people come and go complaining that the game is broken (although I have never seen a major bug that prevents me from continuing with the game), that it does not look like ro1 (what sense would that make?), That nobody helps them (without comments), which is very difficult (...) in short, anyone who wants to try the game, who does it without thinking about the bad comments, in the end we decide if we like something or not. Personally, and as I already mentioned, I love this game. ",1,0

"The game seemed to me like a cross between Sleeping Dogs and Dota2. The scene is Seoul. Open world - there is a surprisingly small map, just a small one. But this is good, because otherwise even more drochill elements would be crammed here, from which the desire to abandon the game arises while passing the plot. Actually, this is where the disadvantages of the game follow, namely its very disadvantage In the side effects, in the plot, everywhere. The essence of the majority of the assignment boils down to the fact that you come, bring down everyone, hack the computer, beat the waves and maybe even ride a typewriter, END. Yes, there is lvla, pumping them, buying improvements, but this is done only to waste time. Well, here it is just pizdec, as it is not enough, it just asks here. It would brighten up this ""grind"". Of the advantages, one can single out: Grinding mobs is more interesting with new Persians, which are enough + each is played in its own way. As for the rest, this game came out ambiguous, and to say that I recommend it would be somehow loud, but in general, it's rather than. ",1,0

"Through the Woods embarks the player on a mythical journey filled with Norse folkore. A third person view allows the control of miss Dahl, a middle-aged mother, whose son gets taken abbruptly away. What follows next is a quest, search, to find out what befell the missing boy. As the story picks off, the mother has not have a single clue who took Espen away from her. A flashlight, and a torch at some point, are the only usable items, leaving her defenseless, which intensifies the players vulnerability enhancing the psychological atmosphere. By discovering clues, notes, written stories and narration two stories come together and build to an end-game climax. Graphics are fantastic for a game released in 2016, apart from some non-gamebreaking glitches here and there. Level desing is done excellently, efficiently giving an open world feeling, well done for an indie title. The forest and its surroundings are a pleasure to roam. Music and sounds effects are good, immersive and add to the experience as a whole. The panting / breathing sounds of miss Dahl for example. More than once i mistook them for some environmental ambient sound, genuinly made me scare. Voice acting could be better though. Protagonist sounds over-emotional, a bit over-acting. Through the Woods can best be described as a walking simulator, rather than a survival horror title. This fact doesn't have to be a bad thing, though. When i bought the game (at a 85% discount), i was expecting a walking simulator with some puzzles and / or search missions. Since the story really slowly picks up and familiarises the player with it's controls and surroundings, i was pleasantly suprised to encounter the darker, creepier aspects Through the Woods has to offer. I am not the kind of gamer who reacts well to horror games, especially not the survival horror ones. But this game has a nearly perfect mix between walking simulator and survival horror, simply because the horror aspect is kept to an absolute minimum. Mostly you are wandering through the forest looking for clues and notes, mysteriously keeping the player thirsting for more as you progress the storyline and the pieces of the puzzle come together. Don't expect any jump scares, instead a more subtle, kind approach to horror. The kind where you get warned when something is about to happen, regarding the save stones where one respawns after a death. One can look at this game as a horror game for beginners.  Game is rather short, having encountered players completing it in under 4 hours. Myself needed 8 hours to complete the story and collect all the achievements, effectively leading to a perfect game. The game lends itself excellently towards achievements hunters, simply because of the fact all achievements can be collected even after completing the storyline. One has the option to go back, using the chapter selection menu, to whichever location the player wants and collect the missing item, note or action. Twenty-seven achievements are up for grabs. Swedish YouTuber ""Zalzar"" has a nice playthrough online, which i recommend. Zalzar has knowledge about Norse mytology and folklore himself and loves to share it with his viewers as well. There's an inset with his webcam footage in the top left corner. Knowing he's playing Through the Woods for the first time, seeing his reactions and facial expressions are often hilaric. What i did was: to avoid spoilers, played for 30-45 mins, then watched the played part of Zalzar's playthrough. Pleasant to see him experience the same scares, reactions and remarks i had myself. Link:  Recommended for:  -	Scandinavian mythology and/or Norse folklore fans -	walking-simulator lovers -	mystery, light-horror gamers -	achievement hunters I did enjoy Through the Woods a lot, which they made more game like these. Antagonist, being a developer team from Oslo, Norway as well, could not have been more appropiate to create a gem like this. Cheers, SultanK ",1,0

"It is a game of making a factory with resources and tools. You have to think about how to bring resources efficiently and how to efficiently use resources to make goods. There are also extraterrestrial creatures, so you have to pay attention to defense. Initially, it starts with coal-based drills and furnaces, slow conveyor belts, etc., but it is gradually upgraded to allow electric mining drills, high-speed conveyor belts, and even robots to fly to transport goods.

"This is a short mini action-adventure game with simple controls and beautiful aesthetics. You play as Miku, a young woman taking care of her younger brother.  As the game continues the story unravels and you discover the history of not only the siblings but the city they find themselves in as well. The game is short - four hours maximum to complete, with the same again to catch all the achievements.  The best part for me was not having to kill anyone.  Yes, that's right - there's no combat.  As an over 40 year-old with arthritis in the hands, FPS are not a genre for me, so this game was perfect.   Some other reviews have termed this a walking simulator, which I agree with - I actually spent about one hour just sailing around in the boat, enjoying the rise and fall of the waves and watching the beautiful day/night cycle spin round.  Add a simple yet beautiful soundtrack and the experience is really quite relaxing. In summary: Combat:      None Visuals:       Stunning Gameplay:  Basic (walking, sailing and climbing) Story:          Limited, revealed through pictograms Length:       < 4 hours (basic game) Music:         Very relaxing and beautiful Price:          Overpriced at $19.99 - wait for a Steam sale to buy ",1,0

"One of the few games that I will put in effort in writing a review It only happen under a few circumstances: 1. The game is terrible. 2. The game is ****ing AWESOME, such as FEZ! Put in hope that there will be FEZ 2, but this is what I get from the news dated back to the year 2014: </3 Why should you try it out? What's great about this game?: + Perfectly synchronise 2D and 3D concept in the gameplay. + Cool story (in its own way). + You really have to think to solve its puzzles, because every puzzle is unique. + Great pass time. + Quite addictive as you will have the urge to make progress. + Most of the music in this game sound good. + You will be curious ""what's next?""/ ""did I miss anything?"" + Less tensed (at least compared to the other games that I play)/ relaxing game + Feels ""solaced"" whenever I got a new cube/ key and Gomez smiles :D + Easy to learn, hard to solve all + It only require minimal storage space and PC specifications! Cons: - It doesn't have a sequel! :( Appreciate every bit of this game - At this stage, there are a few puzzles that I still didn't manage to figure it out, it tests on your intelligence. - Constantly put you into the status: ""how should I solve it?"", couldn't manage to solve it and felt like: ""then how could I go further down????"" Side note/ reference for play time: I progressed from about 6 or 9% to 55 or 59% from midnight until dawn Overall: I will rate it 11/10, and 100/10 gonna buy if there is FEZ 2. ",1,0

The first thing that catches your eye is a nice minimalist interface based on black and white. The game is based on a very simple (but not vulgar) scheme. You have black and white boxes. you have to create a line that turns all black squares into white. It's a cliché, but the game draws you in with its level structure. Even though I won't finish this game 100% (I'm not very good at this type of game) I can recommend it to every fan of the genre. It is also worth noting that the game has a simple level editor built into the game and supports steam workshop and the player can share their works (only they have to complete their board first before sharing). Other advantages. He has cards so the purchase can be partially refunded. I recommend it to fans of the genre. ",1,0
"After passing this game, I realized that Vaas Montenegro does not understand nichrome in madness.

Opponents, after a dozen attempts to ""crush the glaveroy,"" screaming into the fight. The game is good, but the plot freezes a little. Especially the ending. And the replayability is completely killed. That is, the incentive to start the game over or go through, finding all the items and completing all the extras. quests - no, just not. What for? This will not affect the plot and the ending. For a couple of new skins for yourself and for a car? Excuse me, sir.

"After 100% sanding the game, I can only warmly recommend A Hat in Time! Having been very disappointed with Yooka-Laylee, I was between hype and apprehension when I touched the game for the first time. I was quickly reassured, the game is pretty, the artistic direction really manages to infuse a charm to the graphics despite certain obvious technical constraints. However, we regret some animations that are a little cheap, but overall it's still good. The gameplay is taken well in hand. It is not the same richness as a Mario for the movements, but the gamefeel is good, the character responds quickly and well, and the dive brings a lot of subtlety to the jumps. On the other hand, the camera can be a bit temperamental, you may get trolled a few times. The levels are mostly really cool, except world 2 which has a few forgettable levels. But it's still varied, fun and above all generous in terms of content. I particularly appreciated the abundance of Mafia Town for example, which is a pleasant level to explore. Also note that most bosses are really fun to play, maybe a bit long for some. But where I really found the game to be creative is its storytelling. The game itself is quite short (15h for a 100%), but really, the worlds all have a special atmosphere, the dialogues are well written, with a cute humor that never overdoes it, and the dubbing are really tops. The actors are involved, the voices stick well to the character, etc. Usually dubbing for budget prods it can quickly be stressful, but it's going well! Anyway, if you are a fan of 3D platformers and it's the kind of universe that tempts you, go for it! A Hat in Time is definitely worth checking out, and I think it's really the kind of fun game to play, replay, and replay over and over again. Moreover for those who wish it, the speedrun is quite accessible. Most glitches are not hard to perform, the speed of the splits gives you enough time to breathe, and above all the game is demanding enough on the jumps for the run to be interesting to do. On the other hand, hang on for the time rifts, there are some very trendy skips to do! Ah yes ! And the ost is brilliant, a little gem! ",1,0

"This game is the most solid Tomb Raider game. It has the hardest puzzles, levels and longest gameplay. In the new Tomb Raider games Lara said, ""Now I can't do that."" He makes his own decision by saying something and ignores you. But the old Lara in this game is always loyal to you. Jumps into the abyss or the crocodile for you! This woman is both loyal to you and solid like a tank! He does not whine or cry like New Lara, and is always cool. If you are a new generation, you probably think this game is garbage, you are after graphics. But if you don't give this game a chance, you will be rubbish with new games too !! If you are going to play this game, another advice to you !! Once in awhile, play Ajda Pekkan songs by opening them like O Benim Dünyam. Your performance in the game increases even more thanks to Ajda !! //////////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////////////// This is the original and best Tomb Raider game ever made.

"Well, I can't say much about this game because I had contact with it for maybe 1.5 hours, mainly my younger brother plays this game. On a scale of 1-10, he said 9/10. I have already read a lot of reviews about this game I played for a while and I think it's really cool. To the point! ~ Jurassic land is quite a large area that we explore with the help of gradually unlocked vehicles. After the finale of the adventure, we travel through the entire open area - you can find many secrets and surprises here. ~ Classic for the LEGO series, a second user can join the game at any time - just activate the controller. ~ Characters, as always, say lines borrowed from movies. LEGO Jurassic World is a game based on a proven model, which does not take away its charm. Reconstructions of film scenes in a humorous, block-based edition can amuse both large and small players. The heroes are less expressive compared to Batman or Indiana Jones, but plastic dinosaurs compensate for everything. My rating is 9/10 Really, despite the fact that I only played it for about 2 hours, I can say that it is a really cool and interesting game. Regards frxsh! ",1,0

"I have absolutely ALL of the DLC's in this game and I say with propriety that the Strange Things DLC is by far the best of all. Demagorgon, despite not being among the strongest killers, has an extremely fun and enjoyable gameplay, yielding good scares and differentiated gameplay. The survivors, on the other hand, have very good and useful advantages, in addition to bringing a cool atmosphere for fans of the series. Buy without fear, you will not regret it! ",1,0

"Hood. I just wanted to tell you one thing, I really liked your game, seriously, it is the most sensational I have seen so far, it is a work of art, without exaggeration, it is something that, at first glance, could have been done By Da Vinci himself, the genius that he has can be noticed from miles away, not even the worst of gossips could say that we are not faced with a majesty seen only once in a thousand years. I have not seen in all my years of life something of this magnitude, it causes you an indescribable sensation, an immense joy despite not having done any action, a rare feeling to find but fantastic, something like what a breeze feels like in a hot summer, or see the joy of a child when opening their Christmas gifts, or simply be with that person we love so much. Don't listen to the bad tongues who incessantly criticize anyone who does not meet absolutely all their expectations, just believe me and all those beings who consider and admire such a great work of art. There will always be people who are going to tell you that what you did has no value, but the secret is to ignore them, those people would give anything to have created something as magnificent as what we are seeing. Just as God in his infinite wisdom created humanity, or as a man in love creates a poem to express his deepest feelings, or as a painter creates a work of art from some time that even he does not know, this is how it was created this game, in the same way. It may seem that I am exaggerating, I repeat, but it is not like that, not even close, I would exaggerate if I said that I am not before an admirable, incredible creation, of a beauty of biblical proportions. In fact I am so delighted with such a contribution that I decided to write a poem about it, it is titled ""my eyes thank you"", here it goes: - ""My eyes thank you, since they have been caressed, my feelings praise you, since They have been awakened, my heart idolizes you, because you have made him dance, and my being says thank you, for such a delicious delicacy, I will be waiting again, for you to share your joy, even in the middle of the night, or in the most radiant day Just keep creating, creating until your hands are heavy, so I'll tell you again, my eyes thank you ""-. I hope you enjoyed my poem as much as I enjoyed writing it, I would say that you enjoy it as I enjoyed your game, but I don't think there is a situation in the world that resembles so much happiness. To finish being brief, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, one in this life encounters situations that make him feel bad, he thinks that he is not going to find anything good these days and suddenly he finds something like that, it is difficult to decide where one he is going to leave his points, and in fact it is already tiring to report most of the games he watches, I feel that many are created by trolls and people wanting to annoy, nothing to do with what we are observing, here one thinks the opposite, he simply sees it and says to himself ""there must be no place on this earth, neither in the sky nor in the underworld, nor in other planets, galaxies or universes, where it is better to leave my points, I have found the true Atlantis, although it is not a physical place, its simple beauty is enough not to hesitate to make such a comparison "". Sometimes I wonder how much skill or how much skill it takes to be able to make a creation of this kind, sometimes I compare myself with the creators of beauties like this and I think that I am not even a simple human being, next to said creators I I feel like an ant in front of an imposing elephant, like a pawn next to a queen, like a child in front of a superhero from these comics that you like to read so much. Sometimes I look up to the sky and ask ""can I create something that can at least be compared to this game?"" ""Can I ever be as cool, as creative and talented as the creator of this?"" ""What must one do in this life to achieve such genius?"" but no matter how much I ask and ask, I never get an answer. Sometimes I dream that I wake up and in front of me, next to my bed, there is a game like this, but in my dream the game has something different, the creator is me. Yes, I know it seems crazy, something as glorious as this cannot be created by a simple being like me, but we must not forget that it is only a dream. If I could make a wish, it would be that this game never left home, that future generations can observe its magnificence and be filled with happiness with what they see, filled with happiness, madness, passion ... If all the games of the world were like this, there would be no wars, there would be no pain, forgetfulness, sadness. We would raise our heads and singing a song in unison, like a choir of archangels we would say: ""I believe in tomorrow"" ",1,0
"After 11 years, one of my favorite zombie-killing action. I still prefer this than L4D2. You know why and I have so many questions about that game.  Questions to L4D2 compare to L4D1: - Why there's a several animation/audio bugs you can found on that game. I know both of these two are aleeady dead game but can Valve can fix this for once? - Why they banned the addons when playing a competetive gamemode like Versus, this only happens on official dedicated servers but why you so this Valve. I love to play as tank but with Shrek model. - Versus matchmaking are really compeletely screwed upcompare to L4D1. Mostly one of the servers are modded servers (Lewd 4 Dead, Hentai Rape, etc.) whenever I join random match sometimes. Can you only please remove it but you can only find them on steam group servers? - Some L4D1 maps had been fixed on L4D2, the exploits and glitches which is not a complain which is good. I'll give them that. - Atmosphere and settings? I think L4D1 is better. Dark atmosphere + zombies = cool - When it comes to their workshop (L4D2), why is there so many anime mods, so many weaboos. No offense to the anime fans out there but why, there's so many of them which is b u l l s h i t, makes me don't wanna download mods anymore. That's why... I think that's it, there are other questions that will be put here but I can't convert them into a sentence right now. Sorry guys >.< Btw, you can't find co-op servers there because there's already L4D2 but there's quite few playing that game. I still prefer this game, I can even feel more the nostalgia here,  10.0000/10 ",1,0

"Okay, now, without fucking buhurts, I will express my thoughts about the game after 60 hours: 1. Here is quite interesting gameplay, especially if you play with Tim, although the essence of the game is the same as in real football, but with its own features (the ability to fly, nitruha and the ability to jump) ... 2.Customization of the car: Here, even the most avid fashionist will be able to play his design out of dozens of cars + more cars from cases and DLS, hundreds of options for wheels, stickers on cars, its color, hats, antennas, etc. 3.Various game modes + rating, for which different bonuses are given at the end of the season. 4. The difficulty of the game: to learn how to play it at least at an average level, you will have to kill a little more than 100 hours, because it is normal to fly and score an accurate goal, stand on the goal and hit the ball exactly, you just won't learn, thank God, the developers have done training modes where you can upgrade your skills. And the physics of the behavior of the ball and cars you will have to learn too long. 5.Graphony for such optimization is very good. 6. A sore point to rags: the system of crafting rags is implemented here, and for the rink there is a chance to drop a good thing, which can then be sent to craft a rarer item. By the way, here with a 100% chance you get a thing that is rarer than the items from which you crafted. Conclusion: An excellent game and an interesting concept for which you do not mind the money. I advise you to buy. ",1,0

The story once again is one of the strongest points of the game, while at first it appears to be just a pretext for something cliché, the unfolding allows you to glimpse its magnitude, including with some unexpected plot twists. We're back to S.T.E.M., the machine that made the worst nightmare possible in the first game is now improved and its developers promise to be heaven on earth, however ... obviously it went wrong. The enemies are even better, the gameplay is excellent, the graphics are improved and the environment is further explored. The big difference in this continuation I would say is the sandbox freedom that he proposes, while the first game was only linear, in this second you have a relatively average map that allows you to surround and, when you want, to do the main questline, or to venture through there and do some side quests. The system of upgrades has been improved and the game manages to bring the same originality as the first even with the proposed changes, the difficulty is great, making the idea of ​​facing all enemies not always viable, especially when resources such as ammunition and weapons are scarce. A very negative point is the optimization, I played it on a GTX 1060 6GB, an i7 4790 and 8GB of RAM, and the only way to maintain a high frame rate without suffering from stuttering was to play the settings for the medium. Furthermore, let The Evil Within 3 come! ",1,0

But it was well worth the wait! Vampyr is an open world RPG, in which you play a respectable doctor. This by the pleasant coincidences of life ends up becoming a vampire. So far everything normal, but really this game puts you in a few dilemmas (of course if you try to get fully into the story). What was interesting to me is the difficulty question, because this is where the first dilemma lies. You can go killing everyone without investigating the ""story"" behind those characters, to gain more power and advance more easily. Or on the other hand, you can follow your principles as a doctor curing citizens, investigating more about them, achieving a greater immersion in the plot (in the years) increasing the difficulty, but in my opinion you get a better gaming experience. -Simple but pleasant gameplay / combat, it is not very difficult to learn the controls, there are not many, making a better gaming experience. -You can do position crafting and upgrade weapons. I do not want to say much more, since the first impression of the game was left to you. Honestly, I was very surprised at its output because of how well optimized it is and I have not encountered any bugs yet. At the plot / plot level, it is very interesting, there is a fairly well elaborated explanation about vampires, the participation of some characters are vital. But something to keep in mind is that you can kill any character you see, whether it's from the story or not. FINAL NOTE: 9.5 / 10 ",1,0

"The SWTOR is like KOTOR 1 and 2, in a reduced form of story choices. The 8 classes in SWTOR have their own history and with the expansions it will give more than 300h of gameplay in history ... You can play SWTOR as a single player game, if you prefer, but there is much more if you choose to involve the parties multiplayer mode. That's why I think it's better than KOTOR 1/2, both in terms of repeatability and overall depth. The loss in individual story choices is often made up for by all the other things you can do in SWTOR that would not be possible on a single player. Although I would say that playing as F2P is really doing a disservice. The month-long subscription permanently unlocks all the content of the past years and allows you to play without all the F2P restrictions that are everywhere. To an imbalance between classes. Some side missions are almost impossible to finish on high-level planets. Compared to KOTOR 1/2 it has a slightly better history. Some stories from the SWTOR class are excellent for MMO, but compared to KOTOR, they are average. So ... Story in KOTOR >> Story in SWTOR Solo gameplay KOTOR> Solo gameplay after KOTFE SWTOR NPCs and villains in SWOTOR >>> NPCs and villains in SWTOR Graphics in KOTOR << Graphics in SWOTOR Multiplayer KOTOR <<<<< <Multiplayer SWTOR ",1,0

"Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition is a platformer, metroidvania that tells the story of a spirit named Ori, whose adventures take place in the Nibel forest. This story will not be cute, because its story begins with the fact that the forest falls into decay, and the one who raised it dies of hunger. So we have to figure out what led to these events. Are you ready to take control of the little spirit and guide him through all the dangers of the forest? Or maybe you will give up on the first night? You can try to describe this game in the same way as other players have already done - in general, or completely plunge into its jungle. But I would like to just express my thoughts, WITHOUT SPOILERS, of course. The first thing that reminded me of this game (clarification, only reminded, but not a similar copy) is Limbo with Trine. The first reminded me of the amount of trial and error that we have to do. The way we have to slowly explore the world, after all, having made one sharp movement, there may be danger ahead of us, from which we must sharply dodge. As for the second, I was reminded of an adventure in the game world, its narrative, as well as various abilities that we also get moving forward (in the plot). It's a very enjoyable platformer with a beautiful world. In my first minutes, I didn't really like the game, and the reason for this was that I did not understand what was happening on the screen. But the further, the more the plot was revealed, the more pleasant it was to play. It would seem, what does the plot and gameplay have to do with it? But in my case, I really wanted to spend time in this world more and more every hour, to play in it, to immerse myself in the plot. Should you buy this game? If this is your first time playing platformer, then Ori is an excellent choice, which I think will leave you with only a pleasant experience in this genre. It was a pleasant game in which I had a pleasant time spent on it. And I do not exclude the fact that perhaps in the future I will go through it again. Mouse approves! =) ",1,0

I received this game as part of the September Humble Bundle. I really enjoyed this game and played it a lot. The puzzles and the base building works very well together. Pros: The puzzles are fun and interesting (except one) and the progression feels very natural. The island building is very fun and the base building works very well (on KMB) The early game progression is very fast and feels rewarding The islands are beautiful and the game looks beautiful The automation is very fun Early game the dungeons are challenging and interesting Cons: Two puzzles are boring and aren't really puzzles Controller movement suck The large structures sometimes block very important parts of the visuals Combat becomes boring late game just drones doing everything Waiting for crafting becomes very tedious and very boring Theres no way to prevent random plants from spawning on your island Late game progression can become very easily roadblocked by one or two levels which take forever to level up The only way to proceed is to craft thousands of items and spamming them Overall I would recommend this game if it is on sale or the devs fix the bugs and the tedium / boredum of late game ,1,0

"By far the best real life game I know, a game with different modes be it KotH (King of the Hill) or Altis Life ... But the best thing is the new Apex DLC which is available for about 30 €. My little list: Graphics: 10/10 - I love this graphic, the shaders are also beautiful for me there is no better game. (At least I don't have one: DD) Engine: 8/10 - In my opinion, the game's engine is also a successful masterpiece by Bohemia. Bugs: 1/10 - The worst side of Arma 3 are these bugs, you hit a lamppost at 5 km / h, your car collapses and you explode after a few seconds, at least my experience ... Sound: 7/10 Also the sound is just good ... An in-game communication option is possible, there is even a mod in which you get a first-class sound in-game, this is called TaskForceRadio and is included on most hardcore roleplay servers. You can only enter this with an application. Controls: 7/10 - I think it's great that you can switch back and forth between the Arma 2 and Arma 3 controls in the settings. However, there is a big minus point because the game is very complicated at the beginning, but after a a few hours of play it works like clockwork. The game gets a total rating of 8/10 points from me, here too I would like more DLC and updates to increase the gaming experience. Edit: Still good in 2018 -Alessio ",1,0

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R .: Call of Pripyat is a new version of the popular game. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is an excellent and multifunctional game. The essence of the game is survival in the terrible climate of Chernobyl. Stalkers gather in groups to fight off bandits and mutants. The game has a huge selection of weapons and artifacts, textures are drawn at the proper level and the physics in the game is also at its best. Throughout the game, you need to think with whom to get involved in a shootout, because then there will be consequences. You also need to have a good arsenal of weapons to fight off mutants and bandits. Due to the atomic explosion that occurred in Chernobyl, a lot of radiation appeared in the city, from which the mutants went, and it is radiation that sometimes interferes with passing the level. As for the graphics, even now, in my opinion, it is not bad! There are certainly better graphics in other games, but this one suits me perfectly. The plot of the game, in my opinion, is somewhat simpler, but this does not spoil the overall picture. If desired, I think the main storyline can be completed in a few hours. For me, one or two more locations would not interfere with the game and that the transition between them would be carried out not only with the help of guides, but there would also be an alternative to make it yourself. As for the design and the general atmosphere, in my opinion it is perfectly matched! Gloomy, gloomy landscapes, complete with dead factories, cities and small villages. The soundtrack matches the landscapes and complements the gloomy picture of the area. Of course, the graphics in this game are not the best now, but there are so many mods for this game on the Internet that you simply may not have enough time for all these mods, there are also mods to improve the graphics and a new plot, in general you will like it.

I didn't really expect much from this game but when I first tried it and started playing with it it came in unconsciously when I recalled it when I was playing cod united offensive when I was a child. I can only recommend everyone control is also well resolved and can take hours to tie a person to the game the tracks are varied there are many kinds of weapons there are sounds are really good i can only recommend i think it is worth the money and special praise to the handful of developers who have put it together. ,1,0

"Batman: Arkham Knight Plot Before I write about him I will say a few words - if you played Origins, Asylum and City, then you should know - it was just just a huge prologue to the final part of Batman, here Bruce is no longer forcibly held, and since Gotham is his home city, then here he will recoup the villains in full. After the events of City, the city of Gotham is captured by villains led by the Scarecrow, who survived after the events of Asylum, and a certain mysterious Arkham Knight (if you read the comics, you probably know who he is), who wants to kill the Dark Knight, because he annoyed him with something. past, without thinking twice, all the inhabitants of Gotham (who load your video card) are taken out and only you and a whole army of bandits, special forces and villains familiar from the past, with the help of Alfred, Barbara and Jim Gordon, Lucius Fox, Robin and Nightwing (you will also meet longtime acquaintance Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman) you will try with all your might to liberate your city once and for all, but can you do it? Gameplay If you have played at least one part of the Arkham games, then everything will immediately be familiar, we soar around the city, we participate in skirmishes with gopot bandits and special forces, the local combat system remains the same, it was simply improved to the end, also for the first time in the history of games about Our eternally gloomy hero (as if he was spat in borscht every day) a Batmobile appeared (""you can kiss and marry him""), is that good? On the one hand, yes, since you can get to any point much faster, but on the other hand, everything will be extremely connected with solving riddles - to remotely eliminate the enemy from the Batmobile, jump to a certain point on it too, pull out the winch, raise the elevator - everything is on it, turn your miracle car into a tank and endlessly shoot at tanks - and with this the developers clearly overdid it, the riddles of the Riddler (that is, the Riddler) have not gone anywhere, to open the real ending of the game, you have to climb all over Gotham, and there are already more than 200 ""questions"" hidden from, so if you are patient - you can start right now The graphics of Unreal Engine 3 are beautiful as never before, the modification of the engine was very beneficial, constant rain, neon and gloomy Gotham, Bruce's suit wrapped in rain (as one of the reviews on the game page says ""In order to become Batman, as the slogan says to us, first you need to become Bruce Wayne)"" Music Here I will not add anything, as always everything is done at the level e of high-budget blockbusters Let's summarize: The plot: The gorgeous storytelling will keep you until the very end, despite the many cliches - you simply won't notice them, 10 Gameplay: Honed gameplay for all two games (yes, two, Origins does not count) + Batmobile make this game as fun as before, 9 Graphics: 11/10 Optimization: 9/10 Music: 10/10 Grand Total: 9.5 out of 10 If you have a very good PC and miss good games, maybe you are a fan of Dark Knight? Then definitely buy this game, you will not be disappointed in it :) ",1,0

Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very well done game that opens up a sea of ​​possibilities, that will explore your imagination in a way that even you may be surprised. # Graphics / Art: Beautiful, it is based on drawings, as if referring to drawings made in schools when children, however, with a degree of creativity, space, and beautiful environment, the animals, things, people, costumes, are very well made same. # Soundtrack: The background sounds are very interesting, leaving an appropriate mood for each specific moment or phase. # Gameplay: Very fluid, easy to control, to move when necessary, fully balanced, you can change things, etc. # Creativity: It's a fantastic concept, because you can create different things with the notebook, but also, you can change behavior, expressions, you can give or take the life of objects, things, animals, man, just use your imagination. # Solutions and Missions: Some are complex, and others that just need a head to reach the possible, just get a little tired even the side missions, since you need to open the menu every time to see the list of missions and try to read the text again, I admit that it tires a lot, but gradually doing it, it is good. # Plot / Story: Very good and great story, the message that the game sends is very beautiful and combining your creativity with the game will make the story more interesting and remember that you can make countless possibilities, each person who closes this game, will close with several different solutions in the case. # Achievements: 25 Achievements and which are very easy to pick up, some will take a little time, however, calm, it gives you peace of mind and has it listed in your profile as a perfect game (platinum).

"Awesome plot and interesting gameplay! A huge world that you can, and most importantly, want to explore for a long time and diligently! Every turn or exit from a path in the forest can lead to a minor incident or a full-fledged quest! Almost every decision you make has certain consequences. In the world of The Witcher, everything is presented in gray tones: even when the choice seems to be the most adequate and benevolent, in the end everything can turn out completely differently ... The choice comes down to the least evil. At high difficulty levels, you realize that in battles you can't do without potions and oils. This is where you have to spend time in search of the missing herb or run to the market and buy the necessary ingredients from the merchant. The bestiary is striking in its scope: monsters come in completely different stripes and breeds! Character biographies, orders received - this is all a book you read! A masterpiece soundtrack! Incredibly talented musicians who have recorded 100% suitable music for this game! Definitely and unconditionally 10 out of 10! ",1,0

"Ten years ago the first time to play ""Revenge Fighting Rabbit"", then still called Lugaru, should be the first generation, pressing into the game and saw a shape ugly rabbit, what it will not do, under the two people Zousi, After tinkering for a while, I deleted it angrily without knowing how to play. However, at that time, Lugaru had been generally evaluated as a god-made work, so I always felt a bit pity. After many years, I played this second generation, which has been renamed Overgrowth, and found that it really deserves the word ""God Works"", but it is a serious masterpiece. The author is afraid that 80% of his energy is put on the framework. The physical effects are very good. The fighting movements are both realistic and elegant. The fighting rhythm is fast. Usually two or three rounds can be distinguished between the winners and losers. Based on the super strong jump of the rabbit The parkour part designed by Lier is also very refreshing, but the level design of this game is very good. The game comes with 4 plot stories, the process is not long, and the process is very simple. The game rhythm of the four stories is like this: battle-parkour-battle-parkour; battle-battle-battle-battle; battle-find way-fight-find way; watch film-run road-watch film-run road. The more boring the later, the first story is relatively the best experience. The game screen is very rough, it is difficult to accept today in 0202. The handle is supported but there is no vibration, which greatly affects the impact. The soundtrack is a master, although there are only a few. The self-contained level editing function has not been used before, and it is not evaluated. In general, this game is more suitable for multiplayer competitions. If you change your skin, get a server, and pull a group of players, it should be a big hit. It's a pity that Shi is also fate, it is estimated that there will be no day. ",1,0

Before the game begins, each player must select a hero from a pool of over a hundred different characters, ideally fulfilling roles that might be familiar to MMO players.

All in all, GRID 2 in a very competent addition to the racing genre, with some stunning visuals, varied gameplay, and a fun multiplayer aspect that will keep you coming back for more. The game does suffer slightly by trying cater to everyone rather than sticking to all-out simulation or arcade, but if the more casual racers can persevere through the steep learning curve, there's enough gameplay here for it to warrant a purchase.

"First: well-done on the tutorials!  In fact, AC3 has the best all-around tutorial of the first five games.  Even AC veterans will find the tutorials useful, as all the fighting buttons have been changed except for KILL.**   Speaking of:  For a murder simulator, it's a surprisingly chill game.  You've got beautiful environments to wander about in, both in the city and the country.  The Frontier map adds hunting, which is pretty fun.  I mean, they even made quicktime sequences fun!  And I like that AC3 still let me do my ""collect stabby bros and level them up while I climb all the viewpoints"" thing.    And, AND… there's Desmond missions that aren't completely terrible! But I may have enjoyed this one least.  Of course, that's like saying it's my least favorite slice from the same pizza.    Mainly, it's got the same problem as AC Bros - too many side missions.  A chunk of them just left me cold.  I'm supposed to liberate forts for… lower tax rates?     And I'm supposed to help homesteaders so I can craft items based on recipes I got from treasure chests I had to lockpick so I can send caravans out to trade and eventually I might get a quiver that can hold more arrows? I just threw up my hands, abandoned the naval missions*** and endured the rest of the story.   Therein lies the problem.  The story is about Connor Kenway.   Connor is to Ezio what tofu is to mozzarella.   I mean nothing against tofu, but which would you rather have on your pizza? I know, it's a video game – story is incidental, right?  But five games into a series, you get invested.  So it's quite disappointing to have a lead character who is such a dud. This is not a knock on playing as a Native American!  I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes in Mohawk.  The Frontier tutorial, also with characters speaking Mohawk, is my favorite AC tutorial section ever.    Noah Watts' acting isn't the problem either.  Why, there's one time Connor gets a funny line and it's actually funny!  It's just that it happens  . In an earlier game, Jupiter dubbed Desmond ""The Cipher.""   I was like, ""wait, did Jupiter just break the fourth wall?""   That's also Connor's problem.  The events (and characters) surrounding him are infinitely more interesting than Connor himself. The upshot:  definitely the prettiest game yet, but suffers from the same Overstuffed Game Syndrome as AC Bros. ",1,0

"I remember buying ARK back in 2015 and it was fun, new dinos all the time, now the game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i still Love it but 60£ for a game in Early Access?! There is still many bugs. And they think it was good to up the price?!  And with Ragnarok released Scorched Earth is not worth 20€ anymore. One of the main reasons i bought Scorched Earth was because of the Wyverns, and Now with ragnarok you can get all the wyverns with an exclusive Ice Wyvern, Like WTF. Let's just hope they game gets better till Launch... EDIT: Seems like it didn't get better with launch, and they delayed DLC that should have goten released 2 months ago finally got released today (12/12)  and may make people mad if it is not up to expectations.

"However I really wanted to like this game, because of its style and promises, it does not deliver. Technically, everything is how it should be. Eyefinity is supported, wide range of FOV options, controller support,...you name it. The style is cool, I really like the characters, some of the humour. Graphics are a bit so-so, but that can be excused as it was originally intended for the previous consoles, which are quite lackluster in power. But on the less brighter side, the gameplay really did not deliver. The combat is wave after wave of doing repetitively the same. The boss monsters are usually very simple by repeatedly doing a certain sequence, which is in my opinion not really much more than a well-disguised quicktime event. I did not enjoy it at least. The open world-factor is a big scam too. It's really an ""open-world"" yes, but what use does that have if the only thing it serves is being a hub for the next main mission, and maybe some boring sidequests on the line, and the collectibles. Don't expect any open-worldness like Skyrim offers for example. I really can't grind myself through this. There is better out there. Alternative recommendations if you're searching for something around this theme/style:  Skyrim with the Inferno mod. World of Warcraft ",0,0

"This review is a mix of copied out chatbox messages to my friend about the game: Man, my heart is bleeding.  I just finished Mafia 3, and now I'm watching the credits rolling.  Watching how many people have worked on it, and damn...somewhere under this trainwreck there was the chance of a great game.  The story is what everyone expected, but they mixed it up with good things.  It's like Django Unchained, we all know how the western story goes and we all know how will it end, but they managed to do the road from start till the end interesting and enjoyable.  Mafia III is the same, from the start till the end and they filled it with great scenes. But the problem is... they forgot they were making a game. They had no idea how to make the segments between the cut scenes interesting. So... the game itself!  So it has ended as another wasted opportunity, and this makes me really sad. Ezt az értékelés összegyüjtött chat üzenetekből áll, amit egy barátomnak írtam: Hát hallod, vérzik a szívem. Most nyomtam végig a mafia 3at, és ahogy pörög a stáblista. Nézem hány ember vett részt benne, és baszki, ez alá a roncshalmaz alatt egy rohadt jó játék lehetősége volt. A sztori a bevált recept, de nagyon jól rázták fel extrákkal. Olyan mint a django elszabadul, a sztori ott is a kötelezőket hozta, és mind tudtuk, hogy mi lesz a vége, de az addig vezető utat sikerült érdekessé és élvezhetővé tenni. És itt is ez van, a köztes részt nagyon jól fel tudták tölteni jó részekkel. Csak egy a gond, ebből játékot akartak csinálni. És nem tudták hogyan tegyék érdekessé a cutscenek közti részeket... a játékot magát! Így ez csak egy újabb elpazarolt lehetőségként végezte, és ez nagyon elszomorító. ",0,0

"I assume that Brazilian friends, like me, have never played Taslisman. I bought half the kick, and from what I played, I imagine it is a really cool game to play with friends. If you want to try, buy the other edition, Talisman: Digital Edition, which is the multiplayer edition that really emulates the physical game. This Prologue Edition appeals to those who are forever alone like me and looking for a card game + board + miniatures with an RPG look to play alone. You are the only player on the board; instead of AI controlled rivals, the game features quests that you must complete, like ""kill the bad guys and save the princess"". Then you roll the dice, walk around the board, take cards, win items, fight enemies etc. So far cool, right? What kills is the following: let's say you need to take five to fall into the house where the bandits are. You take six, then go straight. You roll the dice again hoping to get one (the game allows you to walk ""backwards""), but you get three, so it will stop two squares later. Roll the dice again, ""go two, go two"" ... four. And then you stay in this dance to fall into the house where you need to fall, fighting against the dice. The nail in the coffin of the game: to close the missions with maximum quotation, you have to solve everything in a maximum number of turns, but how the hell will you manage to close a mission in, say, ten turns, if it takes twenty turns to finally be able to fall in the damn house that has the quest? In short: great idea, bad execution. I understand that in this type of game we fight against the dice, but the worst thing the guys could do in a game with this characteristic was to put a limit on turns. ",0,0

"TL;DR: Not suggesting ep.1-5 for 15 EURs, maybe around 6 EURs. PRO: - Nice character arcs and unfolding, good twists. - You get to play multiple characters in the story. - Intention cohesive! From the very beginning to the end, every action makes sense sooner or later. Mostly later. - A bunch of puzzles are creative. CON: - Console ported. Via Unity. So control on PC is quirky and gets point and click to the bone. Makes time limited challenges   frustrating. Cam pans and switches makes even worse. - Ep1-3 will not be amusing, and you get the Fallout feeling. - You will have some facepalms on some expectable drama points. Could bear some more polish in there. - Most of the things get place in the big picture in the end, but you will have a few oddities stay unanswered. - 15 EUR is too much for this. The thing: Played through the game at a friend, I belive that counts as free :) I like telltales, moral choices and paper novels. Ep.1-4 is... ah well, if you have a rainy day and cave-in felling, it lives up for a time killer...as it has just happened now. Ep.3-5 gets better with the twists, and so pretty interesting. In general it seems as the game got it's wind during the episodes. I very appreciate the outcome, but not to make the players pay to get on track. So as the whole ep1-5 is now available for 15EUR, I would call 6EUR as fair price. Escape Dead Island costs 15 EUR. ",0,0

"I had this game in my library for over 3 years. started it the first time when it released and instantly uninstalled because of bad FPS, lags and unoptimized gameplay. 2 years later i installed it again to see if something has changed. Well not a lot. they basicly removed all zombies because they had performance issues. graphic looks nice because of a lot of bloom but its not worth it the 30FPS. Its a nice game to walk arround (basicly its just a walking simulator right now) and search for loot which you will lose because of bad despawn times. people tried to get arround the despawn times and build KIND of bases with a construction were they block entrances with tents to save their stuff. but most of the time there is always a way intro it. server admins try to counter it with ""friendly zones"". so what is this game about after 3 years? spawn. run arround and try to loot a area were already 10 people tried to find loot before you. Meet people who will shoot you in the back. If you survive this, you will probably fall of the last step of a staircase and injure yourself which will lose you all your loot. you respawn again, find 4 guns, but no ammo. you get killed by a tribe which is owning the server for the last 1.000 hours of looting. server will reset. you lost everything. all the hours in this game for nothing. dont waste your time and money.. seriously + landscape to walk arround -performance -sound (not sync) -Bugs -... actually the whole game ",0,0

"Time may flow like a river, but history does NOT repeat. Secret of Mana is hands down my favorite game of all time. I loved it as a child. I've played it dozens of times and play it at least once a year. I preordered this the day it was listed. If you are like me and love Secret of Mana, go play the original release. This release is a huge let down that I cannot recommend.  Gameplay is WORSE --------------------- The gameplay is a dealbreaker, even if everything else was great (spoiler, its not). The prerelease claim was the gameplay was improved, the reality is anything but. Distances, timing, and hitboxes are changed for the worse. Advanced combat techniques like dash attacks, strafing, or magic stacking, are removed. Enemy and ally AI are worse. The action grid is gone. The ring menu system is worse, you can't tell whose ring is open and there is no memory of last open ring or last selection. The combat just feels awful compared to the original, much less precise. I hate every second of it. *EDIT* As pointed out by Sniperfox47 and C4RNIVOR3, ""the currently open ring is indicated by the cursor color. Blue is The Boy, pink is The Girl, and green is The Sprite."" Still harder to identify then drawing the ring around the character, and lack of ring memory remains.  Graphics -------------------- I despise the graphics, both artistically and technically. To give a tiny bit of credit, within the restraints of the art direction some things are done well, such as the main characters and mana spirits in cut scenes. Secret of Mana was one of the most beatiful and technically impressive SNES games, only surpassed by its sequel. It deservers so much better then this. I don't oppose the move to 3D. It could have been done right. But it was not, the game has the look of a PS2 game, extremely low quality models, textures. and effects. There are so many ways this could have been amazing. They could have stayed 2D, gone with an amazing look like Ori or other high quality 2D. They could have had a toggle back to the original graphics like Wonder Boy or other games. Going to 3D they could have done the game justice, having the same level of quality today that it did when it was released. What they did was make it on the cheap, low quality, low tech artstyle. They don't even animate talking. Music and Sound ----------------------- The music is remixed. I'm not a big fan, but its good they tried. There is a toggle to switch back to the original music. Some sound effects are the same, others are changed inexplicably. Overall, music and sounds is a letdown. Story ----------------------- The original USA Secret of Mana release had some large issues. The translation was extremely rushed, and due to the information density and font differences between kanji and English huge portions of story were discarded. This remake is a great opportunity to bring a lot of this back. The game has voice acting, and thankfully they give an option between English and Japanese voice acting. The English voice acting is mediocre. They do expand the story, but its a really mixed bag. I knew I was in trouble when the opening was missing the classic ""Time flows like a river...and history repeats..."". Staying at an Inn can throw additional story cut scenes, and again these are a very mixed bag. The PC Port -------------------- Generally it's a decent port. Haven't had any major issues. Have had some framedrops and slowdown which is astonishing given the artstyle and my PC, but its a competent port. *EDIT* Have had two instances of needing to force quit, once dialog stuck looping and one animation glitch preventing combat.  Ending Words -------------------- I am glad this port exists, even if I hate it. I'm glad new people will be exposed to this classic game. I'm glad they ported it to PC with decent quality.  But I can't recommend this game, on the gameplay problems alone. The art style is atrocious and cheap. I will continue playing this game until completion. As the worlds biggest Secret of Mana fan, its like a train wreck, I have to see it through. Once its over I will go play the original as a palate cleanser. ",0,0

"Disclaimer: I RECOMMEND you buy this game on sale, not full price. This game can be fun, but it's unpolished and has tons of issues.. I haven't found a proper balance- Rookie is so damn easy that you can easily drop 60+ points 10+ rebs, asts, and steals (per game),  and WIN almost every single game. The AI of your team also seems to be fairly on point. Pro is basically the same- it's slightly more difficult, but it's still really easy. Then, All-Star is more reasonable, but it's still not easy. Actually being able to steal the basketball, being able to pass it without getting a turnover, and making shots more than missing becomes a somewhat rare occurence.  Your team AI becomes worse, and the opposing team's AI improves. Superstar is more of the same, however making shots becomes even more difficult, and your team AI becomes garbage, whilst the opposing team plays top-notch. Attempting to steal the ball will most of the time lead to a reach-in foul. Turnovers become extremely prevalent in this difficulty, as it seems the opposing team intercepts 50 percent of your passes. But, although I have bashed these difficulties, it still is very possible to win, it's just most games will be a nail-biter.  Also, it will likely be not very fun, as you will miss shots way more often, get fouls way more easily, and accumulate turnovers at a ridiculous rate. But, the Hall of Fame difficulty is the real problem with this game. Shots simply don't go in for you or your team anymore; you'll be lucky to make 20 percent of your threes. Steals simply won't happen for you (be prepared to get fouled out), or your team anymore (probably for the other team though). Turnovers will make up a big part of your stats....and you simply will not have fun at this point. It's very unlikely you will win at this difficulty unless you are very skilled. You essentially have to do everything yourself, as your team becomes useless, while the opposing team excels.  The whole difficulty curve thing is just ONE issue with this game. It is so unpolished, with voice actor messups included in the game, pointless and boring cutscenes, repetitive dialogue, server issues, and an insane amount of hackers within those servers.. If you want to have fun, and you aren't that good, play rookie/pro. It's easy, but at least it's actually enjoyable. HoF is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Superstar is stressful, and All-Star MIGHT be okay (I don't remember this one too well. I just know as the difficulty increases, it generally just becomes even less fun. I don't recall a huge difference between All-Star and Superstar). I just feel as if they release these games without even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thinking. There are so many transparent issues with this game... that it's just absurd. Every aspect of this game seems to have some abnormality that ruins it in some way.  I would buy this game on sale, maybe, but definitely not for full price. The online mode is pretty bad- it's filled with hackers, and it's definitely not noob friendly( I lost most of the time). It also has a host of server issues. This game in general is unpolished, and the difficulty curve is just straight-up dumb. I'll give this game a 5/10, but I'm gonna put this as not recommended. There's too many issues that can only be overlooked under a cheaper pricetag. P.S. I wrote this when I was worse at the game, and thus this made my review a tad more negative. The difficulties above All-Star are pretty ridiculous, but All-Star is relatively reasonable and not overly arduous after playing for a while. This game truly is a grind, it's unpolished, but it's very fun, and basically a necessity if you are a big NBA fan. Once again however, ONLY buy it on sale. TLDR; Buy on sale. Game is a massive grindfest, really unpolished, and flawed in so many ways, but it can be incredibly fun. If you're a big NBA fan, and the game is on sale, I wouldn t question buying it. ",0,0

"So, having played over 500 hours of CSGO, I can finally speak out about this game. At the time of its release, CSGO was a pretty good game, but with each update and as its audience grew, it got worse and worse. At the moment, the game is bad in every sense and is more of a tool for making money than a game. Now I will explain why I think so. I want to name the main problems of this game. First and foremost is cheating. Of course, cheating is a problem in almost all multiplayer projects, especially in the shooter genre, but in other games it has not reached the same scale as in CSGO. And the developers do not want to fight this in any way. Yes, they release some updates to the anti-cheat system, he introduced this `` patrol '' and the reporting system, but in my opinion all their attempts look like a confused woman putting a leaky condom on her clients, forgive me for such a rude comparison. Second and not less important is the extremely small number of updates that bring something new to the gameplay of the game. Basically, updates add new cases with skins, new operations with paid passes, sometimes, of course, updates are released that allow you to customize the game I'm talking about new weapons, gloves, graffiti. But they do not fundamentally bring anything new to this game. And I think we all understand why these updates are being made. The third problem with this game is its blessing and curse at the same time. Her popularity. So I'm trying to get you to talk about the community in this game. Namely, the rabble that you will come across in the main. I do not argue that there are enough inadequacies everywhere, and okay, so be it, if they did not interfere with their behavior to others. This I am now talking about those people who like to be kicked out of the game for nothing, or because his opinion did not agree with yours or your actions in the game seemed to him wrong and he probably would have done better. About those people who, when your team is defeated, instead of trying to do at least something to win, they try in every possible way to spoil the game for other players in the team who already have a hard time. About those people who think it's funny to include music in the voice chat or shout any heresy. I am about those people who believe that they all owe them and for any attempt to object to them in your address, you will only receive a ton of insults. And yes, you can try to expel them from the game, but basically these personalities are not played alone and thus they become immune to any attempts to expel them from the game. And there are a majority of such people here, there are certainly adequate people who try to somehow play as a team to do something to win, communicate more or less politely, but there are very few such people and you will rarely come across them. All this can be avoided only if you play with a team made up of your friends and acquaintances. It seems that all I wanted to tell you about this game. I highly do not recommend buying this game. Don't waste your time, money and nerves. 1/10 P.S Forgive me grammar nazi if I made some mistakes in the text. ",0,0
"Im a little bit disappointed with how buggy the game is even in the early access. I didn't expect Larian studios to release a 59.99 euro title game so unfinished for the price. I would much rather wait till next year and have the game somewhat polished and ready to be played with no issues. I found the game in its current state somewhat more of a comic, because of visual glitches, rendering issues, desync and some actions dont function at all. Not to mention my friend i played with had crashes occuring under 2 hours into the game. At this current stage i can in no way recommend it. Unless you understand the problems you might encounter and dont care about your character t-posing during cutscenes.

I could not figure out how to beat animals, although I poked all the keys. A bunch of do not understand why the panels are needed, the benefit of the disconnected ones. The game itself is inhibitory, although the idea is gorgeous, but the embodiment ... for such an embodiment you can only spank in the ass.

"First when i read the reviews on the store page, I saw that people said they have cried with this game so I thought that there are some deep story or good Characterization in this game but the game doesn't have a personality of its own. Its not clear that the game wants to tell a real story or wants just a story to play with our emotion. At the first story you see some tips to use on your real life relations but the story itself is far far away from being real, for the second story (which I have real experience in a long distance relationship) the story of game sounds like Hollywood movies and it doesn't make sense with the tips in the game at all but its the best story in the game and touches some emotions. after all the last story is even the worst one and besides the very very bad story and story telling, its one of the worst P&C games i ever played.

"I liked the premise. I liked the music. I liked the art and didn't mind that most backgrounds are just pictures of real-life places. I liked the premise of the devil possibly not being an entity, but an ambiguous force of nature bringing out the worst in people and twisting them into horrible monstrocities. I enjoyed the final, bittersweet ending.  However, I didn't like the unimpactful, vague and at times cringy writing. I didn't like how most of the endings are basically copouts.

"-Well, I liked the game quite enough to play until the last boss. After several tries (even after reducing the difficulty to easy) I stopped playing it. I'm gonna watch the end on YouTube. But let me get back on topic. What I liked: - First kill - You wear a power armor right from the beginning - Skill tree/system - Map size and variability of areas - Overall level design - Sound design - Game being released uncut in Germany - Panzerhund being slow and heavy. It's a machine and no animal! What I disliked: - Weapon design - Microtransactions - Bullet sponge enemies (Often you pump several magazines into one single enemy and don't even scratch their armor) - Health bars above enemies (Is this a mobile game or a PC shooter?) - No real feedback whether you hit or missed an enemy - No normal Nazis (even the most basic soldiers are somewhat supersoldiers, considering what kind of technology they're using and how they look - more like androids) - As mentioned above: You got to revisit many areas. Over and over and over again. And than again. - The same enemies respawn always in the very same spots each time you revisit an area you've cleansed before. - Companion A.I. - It's the most useless A.I. I've ever seen in a AA- or AAA-game. - If you don't have the right level you cannot enter certain areas because the enemies protectiong the entrance are one-shooting you. And there's nothing you can do as long as your level's too low. - Fast travel system (Took me quite a long time to figure out what areas to visit and what areas not) - Enemies almost always hit you with every shot they take - Drones firing more rockets than they could carry (the rockets alone would be way bigger than the drones are) - No life in the streets except for Nazis (No hiding civilians, no birds, no stray dogs or at least some rats, just nothing) - The game doesn't make items like tapes, newspapers, letters, etc. seem interesting enough to read/listen to them. - Weapon wheel doesn't show all weapons. For some weapons you got to extensively user your scroll wheel or you got to repeat number buttons until you got the weapon of choice. - Single coins are almost useless since you need thousands of coins to buy improvements for your weaopons or new skins. - You can't skip the intro videos - Ridicolous hard final bossfight. It's so hard (even on easy mode) that you'll throw your input devices through the next wall. The fight is split into two phases but it doesn't save between them. So if you lose in the second extremely hard phase you must replay the first phase which is rather lengthy especially if you play with an Bot companion since she sticks to your side, making the fight even harder because you can't hit the necessary parts of the enemy. There's probably even more I disliked but I assume you get my point. Don't spend your money on that game until it's at least 50% off. Hope this review helps someone. ",0,0

"It's hard for me to rate this game because despite the timeline and soundtrack, it doesn't get better in my eyes. I didn’t run the original version, but I’ve heard enough about its problems, and now, it would seem, an ""updated version"" came out, so what have they just updated? Put the game on minikals, purely for fun, and then on average. Why does the game look like I’m running from the symbiosis of PS 1 and PS2 at minimum salaries? Bugs have not been fixed, the mirror also works through the fifth point. Some of the soundtracks are cut out. And it was not for nothing that I inserted the track The Animals, that was also cut out. Therefore, it is not clear to me personally, but what is the point of publishing? Maybe it's that the dlts are in a heap with the game and you don't need to buy them separately? I am even more frightened by a remake of 1 Mafia. 4/10, purely for the hot topics of the time and the soundtrack that complements the atmosphere. But it doesn't cost 1,500 rubles, because I personally don't see any reason to pay for this publication. Optimization, by the way, has become a little worse, which also adds mixed feelings from all this. It is not surprising that the owners of the original were pleased with the updated version, thanks for at least not selling the same thing twice, otherwise the Internet would bomb even more. ",0,0

"This is another in the annoying genre of gacha / microtransaction-type games that seem to pollute Steam these days. Play time is limited to a few minutes in one sitting so it may seem harmless to begin with but as others have said, it's claws get into your wallet if you're not careful. The obvious reason anyone would want to play this is for the nudity and sex scenes. They are mostly enjoyable, but you have to ask yourself if it's worth it. If you really need a fix, there are the well-known websites for looking up the more lewd things that interest you - for free, I might add. And there are alternative games available on Steam that, for a set buy price, can offer similar fun without supplying you with the need to purchase more on-the-go.   is not bad. If you have a big backlog - like so many of us do these days - then games like this really are a cancer on your time, as you look back on the last week, or month, and find yourself not making any progress on your other games. While it's great they're constantly doing events and releasing new content, it can be a bad thing too. Typically if you miss an event, it will mean you miss new women and you'll never again get the opportunity to earn them. As others have pointed out, the sheer lunacy of the prices is astounding, with some of the more expensive bundles sitting at around US$120. It's just not economical to even consider this in a world suffering from massive job cuts and recessions. And the gachas are completely worthless for trying to get some decent maidens, with low low rates of acquisition for such exorbitant prices. As for the gameplay, it can be hard starting out when you've only got a few maidens, but progression can ramp up in speed once you get some good unique maidens / gear / skills. Everything is time-gated - from building stamina, building buildings, earning that little bit of free money or elemental orbs. The game itself is pretty bland, and mostly runs itself, with the gamer only having to do minor interventions such as hitting slow-motion briefly or moving a maiden around to avoid AoEs or avoid an obstacle. About the only rewarding aspect is feeding your maidens lots of elemental crystals, boosting their 'affection' for you. Ultimately I don't appreciate being expected to spend money all the time, I need to look after my bank balance. If you want to throw your money away I recommend paying for an escort - more than likely you'll be helping to fund someone's university course at the same time. ",0,0

If you want to play a sniping game where you can rule on the hardest setting without really trying, this game is for you.

I can't honestly say I would recommend this game, even though it was super easy and had a semi interesting story. It just felt bland and unoriginal to me. Sorry. ",0,0

"Just started this game. I don't know exactly what I'm supposed to do in this game. You start out in a cave level as the title of the game suggests. There are black enemies that blend in well to the black backdrop, which is a cool touch to see in a cave. However, sometimes I bump into enemies on complete accident because of the extremely quick jetpack. Once drained, the jetpack appears to slow down. Besides the above descriptions, all I can tell you from there are various yellow orbs that you can collect around the map. I'm not sure if it's ammo or what exactly, but they are scattered about the map. From there, I'm lost. I think to advance you need to touch a burning flower or something. I'm not sure, but it is an interesting 2D shooter. P.S. Upon further inspection, the tutorial text flashes as soon as you start the game. It reads, ""Hi! This is the welcome text.

"From the very first minutes of the game, you notice that the developer was inspired by such famous games about the end of the world as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and METRO. Heat Guardian is a Top Down shooter set in a nuclear winter. In fact, the game created a mixed impression of all the acting. I put a negative review due to some flaws and illogicality. I will explain all this further. Performed in this product, as well as to match other games of this genre, but adjusted for the cold winter setting, the presence of a Survival mechanic (Collecting firewood on the way to the destination, so as not to freeze, collecting cartridges, first-aid kits and vodka with the need for their widespread use) ... There are only three opponents - two mutants and marauders. There are a lot of weapons in the game, there will be an abundance of ammunition, quite enough to pacify the representatives of the local fauna. 1) Perhaps the first thing that caused criticism was bugs. More precisely, one single bug, but maddeningly disgusting. The bottom line is that bringing the cursor closer to the character (when trying, say, to pick up an object), this very cursor jumps off sharply away from the character, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to select items, thereby, you risk dying early. 2) The next thing that caused .... If not a censure, then at least a misunderstanding is the abundance of weapons with an extremely small number of opponents. Really. Yes, the game follows the canon of the genre, where the player has many different weapons at his disposal, but the problem is that this very weapon cannot be used for its intended purpose due to the absence of any hostile living creatures, and the problem is that of all this variety, only a few weapons have a share of practical significance. Taking, say, Hotline Miami, a classic example of a dynamic Top Down shooter, a reasonable point of view is formed in the minds of players that if there are many opponents, then the number of weapons should match them. The peculiarity of HM is that absolutely all weapons can be used there and absolutely all weapons used will have practical benefits. ""But this is a game in a harsh winter setting, with a hostile world!"" I agree, only the hostile and harsh world of nuclear winter is not so harsh. Really. This problem could be solved by increasing the number of individuals in the already meager bestiary, or by adding new individuals. 3) Dialogues. Meager, boring dialogues that do not reveal the lore of the game in any way, and to this is added another problem - no less meager narrative: during the game, the character will find various documents, however, they do not have any content, except for photographs until the moment of the disaster - no more. 4) Locations. Let's just say that the design of the locations does not give rise to serious complaints from me. Objectively, each location is a route from point A to point B, where the duration of this route is explained by the relief, or by strikes with few opponents. Adding NPCs (Enough even in a single copy) and side quests would dilute the routine wandering around the locations and bring interest to the gameplay. I consider the soundtrack in the game to be its strong point, albeit not deprived of a share of contradiction. The sounds of the gunfire are great, and the music is equally great to enhance the atmosphere. Of course, borrowing is felt here as well, since the soundtrack is similar in sound to the works of Alexei Omelchuk (Composer STALKER and METRO), but the music itself is quite pleasant. I can also refer to the strengths of the graphics and design of locations - the design of the premises, the presence of an isometric projection, which makes it easy to view these premises. For fun, I got acquainted with the creators of the game. More precisely, the creator. This game was made by one person, who was periodically helped by other people (for example, in terms of music), and I think, in general, not a bad job with enormous potential, but so far, the project is not devoid of a number of shortcomings that, of course, need to be corrected.

"Another very short Dlc that definitely does not justify your season pass. The Pillar is the second monthly content made available out of the seven promised by the studio, basically it’s just another challenging tomb that doesn’t add anything to the story, a tomb located in a ruin where you will use the strength of the storm to solve the puzzle and find another artifact. Taking the point goal mode, a new bow and an exclusive skin the dlc pod can be completed in about half an hour of gameplay, this is an affront to those who paid for the ""full"" version of the game. This content should be made available for free, the first dlc ""The Forge"" at least was more fun since there is the possibility to play with friends, something I couldn't even do with this one. Currently the dlcs are being sold for R $ 14.99 each, I would not even recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lara and liked the base game. ",0,0

"I'll recommend this game, but for casual only. The game is very easy to get used to, the songs and rhythm are all very good, the only downside is the horrible self-entitled community. The moment you join any Geometry Dash discord server, it's full of people comparing the top players, arguing over which level is harder, and comparing attempts on levels. It's absolutely disgusting. Most of the players are extremely egotistical just because they beat a hard level.  Let's not forget the youtube community, though. Once again, the comment sections are always full of people arguing which level is harder, which player is better or who took less attempts. Let's not forget those youtube channels which make videos comparing two levels, side by side, in order to get views, stealing the gameplay/content from the original video posters. And on the technical side, the game has a lot of bugs and runs really poorly. It's kind of hilarious how i get more frames in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive then a 2D cube game. You'll find yourself lagging and freezing at random times, and if you alt tab out, and try to alt tab back in, the game will be ""Not Responding"", and you have to wait 10 seconds for it to finally load back in, and if you click at all during the ""Not Responding"" phase, it crashes. It's so annoying. So, if you want to play some levels for the songs and design, go ahead. But I highly advise you to stay away from the cancerous community. Also, the developer, has become increasingly lazy. Each major updated used to take a month or a few, but the last update, 2.1, was in January 2017, over 4 years ago. The best part is, every week, the developer trolls the community by hopping on discord and sending messages like ""Sneak peek coming soon,"" or ""2.2 coming soon"". The wait time for update 2.2 is longer than the time to build the Empire State Building. Let's let that sink in. He's extremely lazy. It's not that hard to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ update. ",0,0

Locked up after just 10 mins of playing. So seems very unstable. Does not receive updates (since release 2016). No official activity in the discussion forums or reviews.

"I have very mixed experiences with this game. I cannot say that it is good or bad. Not THAT, not SHO! She's missing a lot. The first thing that the developers spoiled in it was the combat, or rather, it was reduced. There is absolutely no sense in pumping weapons and combat skills. Again, it is very interesting to play stealth, and again it is not enough. To remove half of the combat in Lara Croft, I think it is not permissible. It is clear that the game, like the entire trilogy, is about tombs and exploration, but there should be a lot of combat, because this is a mechanism, and they cannot exist without each other. This is Lara Croft, and that's it, everything must be present in full, and this must be developed with each part, and not cleaned up and not hackneyed. The plot takes place in Peru, the locations are beautiful, but of the same type. In the previous part of Rise, they were more varied, winter and spring, but they were also more beautiful. The graphics in general have not changed at all, everything is the same, but the optimization has become 2 times worse. At medium settings, my laptop received 45 stable frames, but in residential locations, cities it sinks to 25 fps. Optimization, not delivered, in general, even a feeling that they did not think about it. And the gameplay is the same. You won't see anything new in this game. The only great things here are the cutscenes and soundtrack. I really hoped that in this game they would improve a lot, make a lot of things bigger and better. And in the end, some remained the same, and some became worse, and some more were cut. This is the worst part of the trilogy, and only buy it at a discount. She's not worth her money for the full price. I am generally offended about this trilogy because of this part. Therefore, as a matter of principle, I will not put my thumb up. ",0,0

"I have played this Game for a long time already. It doesn't show up here, cause I used to play over the Launcher not via Steam.  So dont be surprised over my Gameplay-Hours. As far as I can tell it has a lot of bad sides and good sides as well.  First the Positive one: Good FPS even on ""bad pc's"". Good Coop Maps and PvP Maps ( PVE ) which require a lot of Teamplay and Coordination. The Harder the Difficulty, the higher Teamplay and Coordination is needed ( quiet obvious if you ask me ). Good Skins and in general the customization, and yes most of the Time you have to Pay for them ( What do you expect of a Free2Play game??? ). Challanging Gameplay in general.  Good Weapon ""feeling"", kinda feel ""how they would react in those Situation?"" You propably get what I mean here. And now the Negative one, oh boiii: Where do I start ....  Bad Connection ( not 24/7 but enough times, to call it a handicap ). Hackers ( It's to be expected to see them, but that the Developers don't give a sh*t about them is a REALLY bad thing! ). Pay2Win ( I bough myself some Weapons and stuff in general there. But it's actually dumb that the game kinda forces you to buy a VIP Pass. Just so you get enough Ingame currency, to Repair the Armor and Weapons. ) Community ( Can be extremly toxic, you heard of LoL? If I would Rank those two games in being Toxic, then Warface would be on First place. NO JOKE. And once again the Developer doesn't do anything or mostly nothing against such people, Bad thing! ). Glitches and Bugs can happen, sometimes more then enough Times to Tilt someone.  Unbalanced PVP ( If you are a fresh Player then you mostly will get Match-up against, close to your LvL, enemys. BUT it can happen that you Match-up with High LvL players. Which will have better Equipment then you. Either cause they Pay2Win or cause of the LvL itself. Reporting-System is, propably a Meme in itself. People mostly dont get Punished for there Behavier, either it's for Hacking or being Toxic etc.  I dont come up with anything others then those Points. So if you accept such Condition to play with. Then feel free to play this Game.  If not then, dw there are tons of better games out there, which give you better Gameplay feeling etc. BUT you will need to pay for them and Im not talking about Pay2Win.  Btw if you want to Report someone in hope that he get's perma banned, then Record it via the Recording-System of Warface or something else. It helps but it's not a 100% condition to ban ""negative People"" out there. ",0,0

Overheating of the barrel does not exist here at all. Like melee, bayonet-knives. A steep-twisted group of attackers can be stopped by banal bushes, which are here an indestructible object, impassable, unexploded. In addition, the game has a frankly disgusting UE4 optimization, which produces stable 20-40 fps at any settings. Moreover, on High, the performance is even lower than on Epic, while the game still does not shine with a picture. How did they do it? Madskills, not otherwise. The maps here, however, are healthy for playing on UE, with the traditional loading of objects on the move, ""moon travel"" and twitchy animations for players with high ping. But the size of the level and the respawn delays (30 seconds, if you missed, wait for a new queue), the game drives you even more into despondency.

"Brain In My Head is very badly made shooter. Only reason that game like this could be made is for learning purposes for university on last day with tons of coffee and alcohol but that game shouldn't be selled on steam for that price. Music was best thing in the game and it wasn't like really good.   Best thing in the game. Soundtrack wasn't best I heard in games but it was decent enough to stand out from everything else... I don't even know what to put here... Cards? there isn't enough of gameplay to get all of the cards. Achievement? You will have to spend lots of time for them... Developers managed to screw up achievements and this game doesn't fit for achievement hunters...   Everything looks bad... From zombies to environments. There are only few types of zombies and basically they do not differ enough except bosses from regular zombies. On top of that I felt that I wasn't having enough FPS all game.  If zombies chasing you should feel that and now I felt like there is 2 different pictures of zombie changing and that mannequin is moving towards you. No thrill, no adrenaline, no threat were felt playing survival zombie shooter and this is because of poor animations.  You can't change any key bindings at all meaning that you are stuck with keys that developer chosen. AND LEVEL RESET IS R!!!!!!! come on... I reload with that button... Restarted level few times till I got used to that controls even though you don't need to reload because your clip is infinite. And I couldn't change mouse sensitivity which is really bad because it was way too sensitive for me.  You spend all game on the different flying patterns. Sounds nice? no... game developers couldn't manage to build proper zombies so they decided to make confusing levels with lots of space to fall. Yes you can see where everything ends but combined with that weirdly fast movement sometimes you just fall off.. oh and on top of that there is transparent red ground on sides you can walk on and other things you can't jump on. Just overall levels looks bad with different abstract shapes floating somewhere off map and that transparent ground makes it hard to determine end when you running.  Last level.... This was one of the worst levels I saw in any games. Moving platforms isn't fun in this game and killing zombies feels useless because they are just simple obstacle that can be easily killed. Moving between platforms and jumping on some of them is worst part. In the end I died few times just because I couldn't jump on last platform with a boss.   Brain In My Head isn't worth your time and money. All gameplay isn't fun at all, most levels are just too easy and last level just frustrating. The game offers nothing in exchange of your money and time, no fun, no enjoyability and no any skill. I do not recommend this game and I would suggest to avoid it.  P.S.

"To commemorate the distribution of 5 million free copies, try to evaluate it. First off, Payday 2 is a shell and the DLC is real. The belly button is bigger than the belly. It's a full story that costs 20,000 won and a DLC that costs about 200,000 won. So, is the DLC that I bought with money useful? B.. Except for a few, all of the DLC weapons that came out before are rethinking. But also, the game is not balanced. In the past, when there were only 4 difficulty levels, it was somewhat worthwhile. Even without having to use only one type of weapon, it was possible to clear the Deathwish difficulty enough. Since Mayhem difficulty and one-down difficulty were added to the update a few months ago, the balance was adjusted and the DLC was upgraded, including bow and crossbow weapons that users did not purchase because they were not popular. Of course, it was difficult to clear the one-down difficulty with the existing skill combination and weapon, and the users would have to fold it or buy DLC..? In the past, it was possible to clear using a variety of weapons and various skills, but not now.. This is not the only problem.. This part is a subjective thought.. Deathwish difficulty days.. To catch a bulldozer, first catch a grenade, etc. I needed a stun that I used, but this was an interesting element. However, it was difficult to change the difficulty level.. Removed the stun, increased stamina, increased movement speed. Black-black... Another strange thing in the skill part is that there was a skill called Inspire that saves a downed team member among the master mind skills, and this is a skill that can probably raise a team member from a distance. However, instead of saving team members with a 100% probability due to the patch, it has been changed to a 20 second cooldown. The reason is that my team members are all down using the Inspire skill and use this skill to wake up and lie down to wake up again.. It seems like I did a patch to prevent forcibly progressing the game in this way, but I only know one thing and don't know two things. . Even if you raise a team member with the Inspire skill, the number of downloads does not decrease. Even if I was forced to keep it alive, I was destined to be detained faster in the end, but why did I need to patch it? Besides, the skill that I actually upgraded is a skill called the Pistol Messiah that automatically raises an enemy once with a pistol while it is down. If you kill an enemy with an existing pistol, the skill that could be revived 3 times on a master basis can be resurrected once by killing an enemy with any weapon with a patch, and this number can be reset with a'medical bag'. In other words, if you kill the enemy while you are down and recover your health with a medical bag after resurrection, you can resurrect if you kill the enemy even if you lie down again. This makes it possible for users to use the Messiah skill and the skill that can be revived at a probability, and really, very easily and forcefully break the one-down difficulty. This was the most absurd part of what you were doing. The game I used to enjoy has decreased due to this patch, so I haven't touched it anymore. In addition, the barriers to entry are high, so it is difficult to level up without DLC, so I have no choice but to find a bus room in the workshop or ask a notorious friend around for help. It's been very long since I used it, but this evaluation is only subjective, so I hope you don't tackle it. ",0,0

"This is like non-optional hardcore difficulty all the way through, which is crazy, when I play the first Doom (2016) I play through the game a few times on normal difficulties, once I'm very familiar with the game I move on to the harder modes, it can be brutal and but at least I'm prepared for it since I'm very familiar with the game and the map already, no problems there. But when it comes to eternal it's like ""No screw you if you can't handle it just get gut or piss off huh huh"", I've been playing fps for over 20 years, but I have never seen a game push it's difficulty this hard and this brutal when it's completely ""Non-optional"", I should be able to cruise through the game with my own pace first, then I'll try the harder modes, but I cannot do it here. I have no problem with marauder, alone at least,  it's when this sucker paired up with like 100 enemies then I have no time to wait for your eyes to glow, if you want to make a mini boss then don't throw it along side with regular enemy waves, how can I see your pattern when I'm so distracted by all the other things trying to shoot at me? sure it might be okay for higher difficulties, but not okay for normal or easy mode. There are also way too much items to remember, you got grenade, flamer, chainsaw, sword, 4 things to remember on equipment alone, added to the weapon roaster that's like 13 different things you need to switch around during combat, like WTF? These types of games are supposed to be kinda ""Complexity in Simplicity"", like the tactics and ways to approach things are different, but you have some simple tools to solve your problem, too much enemies? A rocket and blow a bunch minions away, long distant guys shooting at you? Sniper rifle (or something similar) can solve it. But here? You have to think""Oh first I have to use the flamer to light some guy on fire, then I'm gonna blow him up with rocket to get some armor, then I'm gonna meathook my way outta here with supr shotty, then I'm gonna dash in the air to get to the monkey bar, then I'm gonna...."" Do you see my point? Like what the hell, this is WAY too complicated, too much thinking and in the mean time not enough enemy is dying, this is not DOOM, it lost it's pureness, it's something else I don't enjoy. I hate dark souls and all the soul like games, it looks like ID Soft is trying to make DOOM similar it to a certain degree, I just want to say STOP IT, make it more like the 2016 DOOM, bring back the pureness of the original, but you can put some of the difficult stuff on the harder modes, but don't try to add too many things to the formula, try again please, this is a bad DOOM.

"The nature of the game can also be scored. Why should I give a bad review? The reasons are as follows: Through the evaluation area, we can see that many players have received various insults from foreign players, and they have chosen clear leads.

The quality is so bad, I don't feel embarrassed. Is it? But it doesn't matter, quality pioneers, just pay attention in the next life. And! Isn’t this kind of behavior of plug-ins be seized more severely? Opening it will result in infertile children and grandchildren! I am not saying that it must be a foreigner who opens it, and we Chinese are not ruled out, but I think This behavior is mostly foreigners, after all, Chinese players are not in the majority. I won’t go into details about this reason, and everyone who has played has a deep understanding.

"I have been playing this game for over 3 years and a i can assure you there is nothing more stressing to experience everytime you play!  I have reached red ranks as killer and i have a lot of experience in the game so i know what im talking about! The map design of this game is terrrible bad designed, where the 4 survivors are always in constant advantage in any point of the game, as a killer you depend on them to do mistakes so you can actually win! There is only one exception but you would be forced to play ""the nurse"" everytime you want to play killer letting the other 21 one killers completly useless, the maps are extremly big making so that a killer is in constant stress and forces him to be everywhere anywhere which is quite literally impossible! There are around 15 pallets in which map that are MOSTLY safe, not to count infinite loops and window vaults, the meta has no variaty, as the survivors can win the game with builds full of second chances perks, making the killer pressure nule! If the survivors are coordenated and skillfull they can win the game in under 4 minutes, and the killer HAS NO WAY TO PREVENT THIS except if you are using the nurse! I would not recommend you to touch on this game if you are planning to try out to play killer! It will stress you and make you mad every time you try to play and climb! The part of the community that only plays survivors is extremly toxic and will make sure to make fun of you and make your experience even worse!  This game should have a look at their map design and remove unfun mecanics from both survivor and killer side, implement more teamwork and wipeout a little of the community, 80% of the maps are survivor favored they should rework second chance perks, remove Bloodlust from killers and buff each singular individual to have a fighting chance and make all of them a little more competitive to use compared to the top tiers. In a game where the killer is supposed to be the strong unit and make the game challanging to the other team is ALWAYS THE UNDERDOG the game is never in their favor if survivors do mistakes, even in the emblem system where you are scored from how many hooks you make and not how many kills/sacrifices, the ""Gatekeeper"" emblem makes no sense since killers have very low/none chances to slow them down if the survivors are split up, since it's release the game has been in a unhealthy state, from a community aspect to a game balance aspect and i would not recomend to buy it if you want to have fun playing games ",0,0

In fact, I believe that Go Mission: Space Travel would have fallen into the most complete anonymity even if it had been released at that time because it is so bad. You have to constantly press the up arrow to shoot, while moving with the left and right arrows. It is very uncomfortable. If at least we could use the other hand to shoot (space bar for example) or at the very least be able to leave the finger on the key ... but no we must frantically hit the key repeatedly at all times.

Other than that, the script has nothing to do with the old games. They got their shit out in order to make a future-themed game in Multiplayer. Are stupid things like superjump, sliding, sliding off the wall become the theme of the future? I don't think such technology will be developed in the future. I don't think we will see soldiers sliding off the wall, superjumping with 1 ton of armor in future battles. Our ability to make independent camo may be the only advantage of the game. ",0,0

"Yes, I would like to curse the review I made when I bought the game for the first time, and I would like to cuss the game in a hardcore way. Why are you still dealing with stupid stupid deeds and bringing an application called Barter Ban that will not work for any money? I went to Turkey to be in the game MMI system servers to 128 servers tickrat not even let him now I do not have the proper protection of tricks. But the updates that are still stubbornly brought to this game are the case, swap ban, etc. Fuck fucking updates happening. Moreover, let's not forget that your efforts to immerse the most e-Sports games ever this year are separate subjects. Add PUBG, Rainbow 6 Siege etc. to CS: GO. There are competing games, and there are still no updates to improve the game. Let's have a short special for the friends who will buy this game: 1-Cheats More. 2-Toxic players Excessively much. 3-Bugs in the game, logic errors etc. it starts to get really boring after a while. 5- While Alt + Tab throwing in each game does not take even 1 second, it does not take 5 seconds more in this game, and it is also 10 seconds in the Competitive match etc. There is alt + tab waiting time at 1920x1080 resolution (same resolution as desktop). On top of that, this time increases even more while playing at 1280x1024, 1024x768 resolution. CMD started to open on its own after using the SlimDriver application, this game cannot be played when I have such a problem! I think it's pretty good reason not to buy it. For those who are thinking of buying: 1-There are game modes that can be fun if you have friends (hide-and-seek, minigames, etc.) 2-Even though the end of the game is worthless shitty items that cannot be sold, by using all your luck (we are talking about a probability of 0.0000001%). There may be good items at the end (don't look at what I say nice, with a probability of 0.001% vs. 1TL. ",0,0

"Excellent game for designing realistic railroads with subtle elevation changes through broken terrain where finding a good route is very important instead of just plopping down a line from a top down view, but when it's time to operate the routes the game is annoying and is very specific about how it wants you to transport the goods in terms of frequency of loading/unloading, time or distance so your realistic or desired line may fail due to unrealistic factors. You're not in control of your operation, the game's arbitrary decisions. There is no AI competition so initial challenge is artificially made harder to compensate but once you snowball enough income it turns into a sandbox anyway, and yet you can't run the lines like a sandbox. I've played many transport building games since Transport Tycoon Deluxe and this is one of the few which didn't satisfy me at all, except for the building part. I would only recommend this if you are highly interested in building more realistic railroads with limits in grade change through terrain like a surveyor but don't care about actually running them.

The funny thing is that in Part 2 you get so many exp items that you can't use if you are already lvl 250, I guess that the devs didn't expected everyone to lvl up all characters in Part 1.

"The game is legendary, we have absolutely no words to it. However, these prices swear by the main man. It became fashionable to dlc to shit and to cold the people.

I'm writing here too. Edit: They made a statement about the price policy. All in this link; In short, he says, they would restore prices and behave more humane. It was not possible to change the price during the summer discounts, so we think to refund the price difference after the discount to those who buy the game expensive during the discounts. Of course, I do not know how much it varies in Turkish Lira. Wow sir, they can call the dollar currency and bring it to the katakulli, I cannot trust it ....

"Again, the case when people go through colorful, unpretentious training, delighted with easy success and beautiful graphics, run to write a positive review, telling themselves that then they will return to the game - and never return. The snake crawls and climbs over obstacles, grafon on the Unreal 4 engine, physics, beauty! I watched the first dozen reviews, no one played enough time to judge the game. Based on achievement statistics, only 4% of all players have completed the game. The percentage of those who passed the game by 100%, i.e. learned to play well, and altogether scanty. This positivist carnival needs a fly in the ointment, and I brought it. The game is not finished yet. It has very complex controls (don't listen to those who advise playing only on a gamepad - it's unrealistic, just fine-tune the mouse's sensor to the speed of the snake) and a terrible camera, which increases the already high complexity. Basically, we control the center of gravity of a flexible long object. His position is very difficult to feel. The game gives us the opportunity to correct mistakes by pressing a key, calling a companion, which raises the kite's tail, and changes the position of the center of gravity. There are two problems: he does not do it instantly, it takes half a second, during which the situation will hopelessly deteriorate, and is located randomly, i.e. pulls in an unpredictable direction. Therefore, a feature introduced to facilitate the game actually breaks the game. Get ready that you will die hundreds of times, that seemingly simple things will not work. Get ready to break your keyboard and mouse in a rage. Yes, the game is infuriating. The first levels are good, but then the hack begins. Levels 9-12 are stupid and ugly. This is why only 4% of the players completed the game. It’s not a matter of frustration, it’s hard to piss me off, it’s not like that, but I cannot upvote for an imperfection.

And remember: it doesnt have a single anticheat. Call it ""game""is a difficult thing for me. Multiplayer part is pure digital DUSTBINS. The only decent thing is the single player campaign (yeah, is on space, but this time, anyway, is really really good, in all aspects. It deserve to be played) and zombies, really cool mode, greatly challenging and amazing played with friends. Besides, they started with a BETA: no leaderboards, a sort of statistics, cr@p maps, full of bugs and missing options. And to make matters worse, it sold both steam and Wstore WITHOUT being multiplatform, so players are divided and can not play together. The database, therefore, is destined to die early, already today the numbers are ridiculous, sometimes BO3 has more people of IW. As for me, I just have to wait for the next Treyarch cod, hoping that finally return to basics with lifelike weapons, larger decent maps, and especially without ridicolous jumps, walls run, jetpack and all this cr@p that make it ridiculed for years. 5.9/10 ",0,0

"The only word I can say for this game is that it should definitely be remake. Going to the overview, it would be ridiculous to compare it with The Witcher 2 or The Witcher 3. Because it doesn't have a quality on their level. Okay, it may have been out in 2008. Although this may be the first Witcher game made, I really think that in a game there should be that guidance system that marks the npc you need to go after taking the task, the simplest one from the fast travel system that does not have combat, map system, but actually should be. The game can be really beautiful in terms of storytelling. I have no words to this. I have no words for those who finish such a game despite their systemic problems. I really congratulate these friends. But if you are a new player (by this I mean if you haven't played a lot of games before and someone has recommended you this game series somewhere), what you need to do in my opinion is that you don't waste time starting directly from the second game after watching the video that summarizes the story of this game.

"Updated Note:  as of 03/2020 So at the time of this review I didn't see that they have the original version CE version ( not f2p version) for purchase on steam.  I'm not sure if this was added after my review or was there before the review.   Either way, while I do not recommend playing the f2p.  I want to recommend the original purchase version they offer which is not the f2p, but the real game as it was offered when they made it.  I really like this developer's games, have quite a few of them.   I like the style of it, the cut scenes are nicely done.  I like the collections and morphing objects.  They give you plenty of extras, plus bonus game.   travel map, etc. so if you stumble upon this F2P you can try it but look it as a demo, don't play through the whole game here, but if you like what you see, then I do recommend you buy it rather then play through this only to find you won't be able to continue to enjoy it as you can see why by my review and others.   ------- my previous review for the F2P version.... So this game once was a game you purchase.  I can't remember if I have this from another platform (BFG) or somewhere else but I am pretty sure I played this before.  Here though it is the collectible version but F2P or so they would have you think.   The game overall is enjoyable.  I like this developers games, have some, played them before however this one you can't play the bonus chapter without then purchasing it and you have I think like 5 hints they will give you for the entire game unless you buy coins or something like this, honestly I didn't buy anything and all I could see was these coins to purchase but nothing really indicating what they were for exactly.  so  for that I can't recommend the game unless you don't mind not playing the bonus chapter.  if you do get all the morphing objects and the collectibles throughout the game it will open up bonus mini games to play or something like that but I didn't see a way to simply continue to the bonus chapter without buying 30 coins for 2.00usd.  if I am going to pay for this then why not just go back to making it like the others in the series, full CE edition including the map where you can see if you have morphing objects still on that area as well as what activity you have in an area.  The game before they changed it to f2p had this.  The map now is only a travel map. ",0,0
"Already after an hour of gameplay, I caught a critical bug, where at the end of a move one of the computer opponents is buggy and causes an irreversible crash of the game. Moreover, it was on the standard map ... And this is not to mention the tons of missing functions, such as convenient division of units by hotkeys, the space bar, and so on. Yes, the graphics are superb, but with a ton of bugs it's unplayable. P.S.: GUYS FOR YOU UNDERSTANDING, HERE THE MOUTH AT THE LOCKS WHEN PROTECTED DOES NOT DAMAGE =) ",0,0

"I bought this ""wonderful"" game a year ago (maybe more, I don't remember), and you borrow what? Almost nothing has changed in the game since that moment! Yes, of course the developers have updated the model of the machine, added a couple of sounds, several of the same type of cards and 1 mode. I expected something different from this game ... do you know what my feelings were when I bought it? I was happy! I thought it would be an awesome game soon, because this is only alpha, the players said that they would add all kinds of monsters or it would be partly horror! after all, there were soul-tearing screams when killing an enemy ... but when I came in, I ate a little *, it feels like the developers have abandoned this game and are giving out minor updates!

Sound, no complaints, everything is fine. But this is where the positive ends. The plot is a piece of lame dog shit. Sometimes it contradicts the logic of the game itself. And oh God, pathos. There is great pathos - Warhammer 40,000. And there is pathos - Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, from which just a hand is a face. I was pissed off by all the characters, although no, Hitler succeeded, but he is stupidly copying the film Bunker and Tarantino's inglorious bastards. Degrading jokes, like when Fergus begins to hold out a rose to Maria and his prosthesis stops obeying him and grabs her by the chest. VERY FUNNY. But the top heroes are Grace Walker. So nobody froze me out with their behavior. It feels like all Matryona's friends from the TV series Everyone hate Chris have moved into one person. Her this way of talking - listen to the bitch here and waving your finger. In short, who saw what I mean. Horror. This is the first game to the end of which I started skipping videos. In short, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a tale about the struggle of a gang of drunks / dudes from Black Lives Matter / a pregnant woman / Blaskowitz / not like everyone else / artists and other creative personalities against the Nazis.

"This is the typical game that I would not like to give negative, but I will be obliged. The poor optimization is one of the factors, you are locked at 30 fps and if you want to run at 60 fps you have to run after the tutorial to unlock. Only the optimization is so bad that if you leave it at 60 fps in the cutscenes where there is absolutely nothing special, in my experience with a GTX 1070ti it was 80 to 90% unnecessary! In comparison, without being cutscene the game runs at 40 ~ 50% usage. Another factor for me was a bug where the NPC that I went to speak to do a mission entered the wall and did not give me the option of dialogue making it impossible for me to do the mission. I chose to reject the chapter I was in (because of a bug) and to my surprise all the safe houses that I had unlocked were no longer and even worse, the time for detonation was at the same time before I decided to reject the chapter ! That was the culmination for me to uninstall and get frustrated with the game. But don't get me wrong, despite all that the game is just too much fun. Countless zombies on the screen, absurd amounts of weapon combinations and the strangest and most bizarre cutscenes and dialogues I've ever seen. I venture to say that it is the most fun Dead Rising I've ever played. It's a completed game to spend hours having fun. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience because of optimization and bugs. Sad.

"Initially, my first impression of Wild West Saga was that it was just a re-skin of AdVenture Capitalist. I liked it though, I've practically done all that can be done in AC, so I figured this would be a refreshing change, and it was for the first few resets. The issue came around the 10th reset, where I started going from minutes to an hour between resets, all the way up to several days. It was a very steep curve, but I waited. After that reset, now I'm at 16 days til the next reset. I've been throwing money into the 5x multiplier every hour (if I didn't, I would be at several months til my next reset), buying every card when it's available on sale.  I haven't spent beyond the free in-game currency given from perks, and I still have plenty left. What's the deal here? The game progresses WAY too slow and jumps up too high. 16 days between a reset at only a few prestiges in is far too long. This is fun initially, but the progress change curve that goes far too steep, too fast, is just not a fun experience. I'll probably revisit this if they can tweak some rates, otherwise I just can't recommend this in it's current state. ",0,1

"I have had this game for a few years now, I've played solo and multiplayer and gained a good understanding of the game. First off, you spawn on an island just after surviving a deadly crash. From there on you are required to build hunt and survive especially before night when these human cannibals spawn and attack you. At this point the game is good the graphics are fine and the mechanics are perfect. Night time. Everywhere is human cannibals hacking at your shelter and you, they are O.P and you need to know what to craft before even starting so you have plenty of time. Now whilst doing this in solo it was a lot slower and creepier as sound effects enhanced the experience. Now from this point the game was not so great, after retarting multiple times from death I hated the game.  Now after that paragraph about solo lets discuss multiplayer. Same start and all however you have a radio and you can go to other people in the world and also make contact with them in game. I make my way to a group who build a huge fort and house ready for the night. However the controls are incredibly confusing to communicate and spend serveral minutes trying to figure out how to talk. Night time hit. Same outcome we all died due to O.P human cannibals. The game is not the best. Although the graphics are incredible and the crafting manual that you get given at the start is straight forward and easy to understand.  This game is a unique game and requires exceptional skill and knowledge of survival and survival games to survive in this, if you are up for a challenge against incredibly hard cannibals in a lonely echoed forest go for it! Although I do not recommend this game as it is boring, unbalanced and just plain dumb! There is no storyline and there is nothing to work for in this game. Please do not buy this for young kids as i guarantee you they will be wanting to sleep in your bed for the next month! ",0,1

"This game had everything, an awesome story, almost a masterpiece of the 1st season, it only remains to implement it correctly. But alas, they could not. The price tag of the game is more than two thousand, for such a price I simply have to demand top-level content. And what in fact - the cutscenes are miserable to impossible, just the finish. The battles are varied, but in reality it quickly gets boring. Instead of an open world, there is one standard location that you can run around in online mode, where other players in the form of avatars run around it. The plot is a retelling of the 1st season, but slightly modified for the avatar. Such a game should cost 400 at most, at most 500 rubles, and not more than two pieces.

"The game has several interface issues, both in menus and in play. This can lead to frustrating, unintended gameplay interactions, as well as locked up menus (requiring a game restart) or sounds that ignore your in-game volume settings, or so forth. All on top of a woeful lack of access to any kind of menu interface while in a match (ie, to adjust sounds, leave the match, etc). The game only has a 5 minute tutorial mode for single player, there's no actual campaign. I couldn't find any co-op functionality at all (presumably the developer isn't very familiar with games and instead intended to reference local pvp), so the game is mislabeled. At a glance, the game balance appears iffy in places. The core concept and the manner by which the physics interact is very appealing, but this game appears to be nothing more than an abandoned prototype at its current state. Given that it's free, it's an interesting proof of concept for a full-fledged future game (one that I'd personally be interested in playing), but it doesn't yet have either the polish or the substance to be recommended to anyone for play.  If you're simply curious about the concept and have 5 - 10 minutes to kill, go ahead and give this a shot. However, if you're looking for something you can actually get some real gameplay in on, give this one a hard skip. ",0,0

"OK, so let me tell you about the one aspect of GRID 2 that was irritating enough for me to stop playing it for a few weeks, and then when I came back to it, irritating enough, again, to uninstall it for good. I am well aware that pretty much every racing game uses ""tournament"" modes to prolong gameplay hours. That's fine with me. But GRID 2 takes that concept to a ridiculous level. You have the Touge and Faceoff ""tournaments"". Here's how they work: You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK. I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a ""hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row"" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves. So yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me. ",0,0

"As VNs go, this one struck me as a bit... miserable. Setting the scene: a boy is living a pretty dull life, worried about his weak sister, almost always hospitalised, not particularly serious about his schooling, and cooking and looking after relatives with unusual working hours. He gets dragged to a dinner by his childhood friend, Ai, doesn't realise the time so ends up rushing to try to catch the last train. Before you know it they get transported to another world. I only went the one romance route - with Ai, as it seemed the most natural. My experience did not want me to play the others, so I cannot speak for them, but some of the themes that crop up can be a bit disgusting. I suppose it's only natural to expect this type of thing from VNs these days, but I find myself asking if it's really necessary. The first problem is the 'sis-con' theme. Is it just commonplace in Japanese culture or are there just more weirdos than I realise in the world? I have a sister in real life and every time I read some rubbish in VNs about the protagonist or his friends teasing him about 'sis-con' it turns my stomach. It's utterly gross! Including this type of content in a story does nothing to make me like it or enjoy it more. Even when your supposed 'older' sister asks you to have a bath together and the guy eventually agrees in a room full of people... ok, yeah, because that is normal. /endsarcasm Not just that, but the protagonist is stupid. There is no other word for it. I'm no expert on relationships - I've been single all my life - but following the path of Ai, there are so many hints dropped in his face, and he never gets it. It's painful to read how stupid he is. When a girl has to scream in your face 'I love you!' and you're still clueless, you lose all hope for good storytelling. Good storytelling is being able to suspend the reader's disbelief - no way is it believable someone could be this dense. If I were lucky enough to have a girl childhood friend this long, and one that would deliberately fail tests just to go to the same not-as-good uni as me, I think I'd sit up and pay attention. I'm impressed there is voiced characters, but the art is pretty tame - especially backgrounds - and the gallery unlocks don't seem to be anything special either. The 'regular world' backgrounds are like looking through a car window getting rained on too - if it weren't for the characters themselves I swear I'd think I was going blind. So I came up with my own ending, I like my version better. I spoiler tag it because by you knowing this isn't what happens, you can infer what does happen:- ",0,0

"The port is the last shit. I could hardly play the game with the keyboard and mouse because the controls were so vague. It was only playable after buying an X Box 'controller (which was not bought directly because of the game). Even then, the port just upset me and was, in short, a disaster, for example at the beginning I couldn't read whether the menu read ""destroy"" or ""equip"" because the tips that I hadn't needed covered it and destroyed it I got a 12-gauge shotgun for which I had ammunition in exchange for a table leg. From that point on I turned the game off and was a lot more frustrated and excited than amused by the Bad Port. I also noticed that the light and gamma looked very, very strange at the beginning of the game (all orange). I could be wrong, but if not, the port / game has gotten even worse in my eyes. I have often had problems with games that were primarily developed for consoles and I am hopeless compared to the cheapest programmed computer ports (Assassins Creed 3, Call of Duty Ghosts etc.) and I will not put up with that. In short, you should say about the game that it might look good on the X-Box 360 / X-Box One, maybe even be fun, but if you are so greedy for money and want to sell it to PC players, that The game has to port at least well programmed, because what the PC players had to endure up to now were ridiculously bad, smeared ports of popular console games that the publishers have not even improved. 2 / 1o points, a ridiculous port.

"Dude this is a goddamn card game! But there is something that makes it different from the others. So what is this conversation? -The cards we throw are 3D animated and live competition. Yes, the only joke is that disperse ... Anyway, let's say the gameplay part of the game or the learning part. First of all, we have a bridged field that connects mutually and we can throw our card at any point in this field. These cards are divided into spell and character cards. We can throw Spell cards instead of ""including the opposite tower"", but we can only throw the character cards at a point we want in our own bridge area. After throwing our card, it moves towards the opposite bridge and attacks the opponents who enter the attack area, which if it does not die, continues to go. When he comes to the tower, he hits the other team's tower. Tower main characters also attack this card. Each card you throw has its own unique ability. At the same time, these cards are divided into space and air. If you didn't throw a card that could hit the air or go up in the air. As they continue to attack your character, the card you throw just keeps moving forward. We set up decks for ourselves and enter the game with this deck. We can use the cards our deck has. Of course, the Masters, our main characters, also have their own abilities. So what you have to do in the game is to know what to throw at which card! You have to throw the right card in the right place and remember that your deck comes randomly. You cannot start with the same card in every match. You will see 4 cards and these 4 cards are given to use in a random shuffle form in each game. In addition, if your opponent's deck is more dominant than your deck, you can play strategically and maybe flip the match, but it will force you. In other words, both luck, knowledge and strategy are required (To achieve success in the game). Once you know them and get used to the game, it's easy to play strategically. The game is not bad yes, but the player base is not nice. Most of them do not know the game and no matter what your league is, especially in team matches, someone who does not know the game can come to you. It's too much ... Also, there are optimization problems and abidic gubidik game kicking bugs in the game. If you drop out of the match because of the bug, don't worry. Because the game makes you lose the match by saying why did you come out with the horse head and as a result you may fall in the league. This problem has been fixed, I think if you fall from the match, you can continue the current game if you can connect back quickly, but your tower will be damaged or exploded until you enter. Anyway, if I will touch on this terrible player group of the game for the last time, I would like to share a few lines of the words I wrote in a very rageful situation in my first review. A few of them in ahan; - I have not been able to figure out why this game, which has a brain as much as a nut, comes to this game, which is a strategy game that is a slow game card game. We are playing GrandMaster League in the game, the man who came to my team does not know what card to throw. What does this mean? If you can play the game, you will carry it almost completely in the team match, but sometimes there will be so many good guys that you will not even be able to support the man no matter what you do. It is really a game that should not be played and the battle pass event, so when this season is over, I permanently delete it. Don't play, don't play, I'm trying hard not to get an archer tower right now. Don't bother yourself by increasing your nervous stress level. Yes ... I don't know if anyone has ever read it, but what should we say, the decision is your friends. If you say I play boredom without worrying, it is a game you can spend time but don't stress yourself. Have a nice game ... ""Archer tower moves away by giving lower music ..."" ",0,0

"I don't see any sense in writing about the game, everything has been said and discouraged for a long time already, it is obligatory to get acquainted, an excellent story game, but there are a few words about REMASTERED. It's a shame when the emphasis in the remaster is put on some stupid little things that you run past and don't even notice, but the really buggy and shameful moments in the game are calmly transferred without the slightest changes. I remember back in 2007 I was spitting from a sound error at the last level, where you and your ""sister"" walk around and collect Adam. She constantly repeats the same phrases there without stopping, as a result, you listen to the whole level of endless sound spam, killing the pleasure of passing the level. Obviously, this was not intended, even more, in BioShock Infinite, the developers initially wanted to make Elizabeth voiceless, so as not to annoy the player with repeated phrases. And you want to say that these same developers, in the Remastered version, have not bothered to fix such an idiotic bug of the first part with spam of sister phrases? I will never believe. So they either do not care about this remastered, or they have nothing to do with it. Be that as it may, it is in any case sad: the word ""Remastered"" in the gaming industry has already become synonymous with the word ""Shameful hack"". And if you talk about graphic changes, then on youtube you can see a comparison of the original and remastered in terms of graphics, you will see that in many points the original looks better. What kind of hands do you have to be to make this happen? But they added jellyfish outside the window)) As a result, 1/10, I recommend playing only in the original, even if you received this hat for free. ",0,0

"I saw this project as an advertisement in one large social network. I read it, looked, like nothing like that. I even signed up for a beta test. And here it is, the opportunity to try the game, in Early Access. Yes, I know, early access is a beacon that shows that the game is not over, but ... I didn't think it was that bad. I have a lot of games in Early Access, and at the very beginning they were completely empty, but they had an interesting idea, albeit with a poor implementation. Later, the implementation was tightened up and the games came out good. Here ... no implementation, no idea. I really wanted, as it was said in the description, ""The project will be similar to games like: Prey, Breathedge, Portal, Tacoma, The Turing Test"". I played everything except Tasom, and ... I don't know, maybe I didn't play that way. In 18 minutes I found an insane amount of bugs, not convenient controls, not logical controls, terrible character animation. Let's go in order. 1. Starting the game, you have no way to customize the game. I was lucky that the game detected my computer and set the maximum settings. But the sound! He screamed! The settings will only appear in the game loading animation, and only in the game itself. There is no initial menu before starting the game. 2. During the download, music plays, which is difficult to say ""pleasant"". Maybe once, but after the third time, it enrages. Moreover, after you agree to continue the game, it abruptly disappears, like all sounds. 3. After the simulation has started, by clicking on the letter ""E"", which is usually used for the USE function, you will open .... settings! Well this is brilliant! Ok, you can reassign the keys, but this is at least not a logical layout. 4. After entering the menu, changing the settings as needed, the menu will not close until you click ""Apply"" or ""Cancel"". Pressing Escape again does not close the menu. This is already a nit-picking, but not convenient. 5. Animation of the character when walking and running. Whoever launched AnrilEngin at least once (it was on this engine that the game was made) most likely used a character sewn into the engine. Here he runs and walks the same way. True shaking of the head and arms while holding the weapon seems to be absent in the standard ""set"". Already good. 6. Shooting. Peculiar. It seems to be a camera ""from the shoulder"", but aiming is not classic. Because of this, shooting at the corner of the wall instead of the enemy's head is a constant practice. 7. Dialogues. For 18 minutes I did not see all the dialogues, but what I saw was sad. There are many answers or questions, but the bottom line is one. The character is told the same thing, so that he does not choose. Such to myself. Although funny answers, especially about children, amused. In addition, the dialog boxes themselves do not scroll. Spin it yourself if you want to read it. Yes, and it is not convenient, and not beautiful. It would be better done with subtitles. And so it resembles the ancient Stalker. 8. Overlays with translation. There are several points where English was when Russian was chosen. Moreover, if at the very beginning they started playing, the game is completely in English. After a long introduction, which cannot be driven away, you have set up Russian, the game will prompt you to re-enter the game. After reviewing the introduction again. Although even without restarting the game, the Russian language appeared in the game. A strange decision, to put it mildly. 9. Enemies. Well, the AI ​​is very stupid. Shooting at me through the wall is generally the height of genius. Moreover, they all always walk along the same given trajectory, one after the other. There was never that they came in a crowd. Follow the trail. Pleasant. 1. I liked the environment. Everything is like screenshots. And it's all. I returned the money, at least 150 rubles is not a lot of money, but I'd rather put it in a kind of piggy bank and buy what I wanted for a long time.

"Well, what can I say, it looked promising, and at first it was even played with interest and desire, but then something went wrong, or so it was. They pushed me to distribute the game: - There is no balance at all, at the start there was none, and it was interesting to play due to the general stupidity of everyone, and after a couple of days you will be greeted by 30-50 levls. Cuckold is obviously a loser here if you play against a boosted party, there is no chance. Against equivalent lvls, the chances appear, but they are just as small. Cheliks who run one by one here, yes, there is a chance. There is no need to play for the survivors of the mind, run in a crowd together or at least not get out one by one and use perks, always one hundred percent wine. -Donat boost for shekels, drown in and sleep - Lootboxies, our favorite lootboxes. -No anti-chita, but what does it mean, yes, a stillborn project with support for a ban via twitter or the like.

And since he is not there, then there is a bunch of chitaks and all the rest of the evil spirits, and this is defining because of which you do not want to play it. -Super long search for Kukold, well, it’s not at all bearable to sit and wait for the devil how long and it’s not a fact that you will wait, and if you do, they will throw super raging cheliks at you and you can continue to burn the chair with point-thermite welding. But at the same time, the game is for the survivors in a split second. -Lags, super ping due to which the cheliks are teleported throughout the lock, as I understand the game is played by so few people that they throw everyone at you: from the USA, Japan, Mars, Venus. Are the Persians schoolchildren? Wtf, custom Persians were too lazy to screw it up? Well at least the cuckolds were not made their teachers.

"I came across a Redit post about the source code being given out freely. As I was not an advant player, its difficult to see how legit it is. Can someone reply with further information? Im incliding the link, but will remove it if Im given a heads up that its invalid. Greed can make or break a game. Thats exactly what hapened that resulted in so much reported chaos, the servers were shut down for good, and staff left. The game did as intended, made them money, when it stopped due to reported issues of hacking and pc version not working, they abandoned everything, except the money taken. What led to this? Servers and clients got updated with new software that allowed phones to play as well. In this decision, servers were reported being hacked and nothing done, many players left. Ones who stayed got hit with a new issie, which appears to be a license expiration. Last time I seen this error, the company who made their title updated their game making software, but not the modules that export to different accessories. The modules were set to expire, and did. Company was forced to spend $500 to $750 per module. Most likely with Deepworld, they wete either unwilling or by time they found out, unable to pay these fees as their cash cow died. Maybe one day if this game is popular enough, an emulater will be made. -- old post below -- .2 hours and almost a year to do this review. This is because at the time, doing a review for the game was pointless to me. It took .2 hours to find out in order to play, I really had to pay, and I was already playing similar games at the time that were one time purchases, so why do a review, for a game I was just giving up on? After seeing some of my friends who took on the game play much further than I have, and even lost a lot of money doing so, and to find out they tried the game not because I didn't do a review, but because it was in my list with no information, so they wanted to try it as well, sort of makes me feel guilty, that they wouldn't have tried the game in the first place, had I put up a warning like this.  Another reason I quit playing the pay if you really want to play game, was because despite the graphics being different, the mechanics feel the same, and it was then I did some late research in past failed games, and discovered that this game may very well be the freebie a group gave up on, but gave permission to continue on in hopes their work would at least get some recognition.

"Firstly, I have had issues with this game since the day I bought it. I'm currently on the last boss in the story and even that bugged out and used up my last faint. It was knocked down on the other side of the room, I was on fire so rolled to put it out and all of a sudden my health dropped from almost full to zero. He was knocked out throughout this so it wasn't him attacking me. The amount of game breaking bugs like this that have happened is record breaking. You press a button for the game to do something and it straight up doesn't do it. Call your Palico to give you a vigor wasp? It doesn't bring it. Spam the button and it still doesn't do it. Mid way through a fight? Expect the game to sheath your weapon without pressing the button to do so. Want to stop to take a potion? Sheath your weapon and drink it, oh wait, it doesn't let you. Spam the button maybe? Still doesn't let you. It's ridiculous. These aren't exaggerations either. I wish they were but they aren't. The devs should have took one big, deep, detailed look at this game before releasing it. It's shocking.  I've also found that monsters quite often sink into the ground and still attack you but you are unable to attack them. They just become one with the rock as if their atoms have fused. This isn't Ben 10, the monsters shouldn't fuse with the material they touch like Kevin. The devs really need to go back and fix a lot of issues. One of the things that need looking at (this one isn't a bug) is the ridiculous, painfully long time it takes to recover from a stun. The animation doesn't need to be so damn long. Same goes for when you faint and get thrown off the cart, stop making the animation so damn long. It's unnecessary. If you want a game with fluid combat, movement and a minimal amount of bugs then this is not the game for you. If you are happy to constantly die to the hands of game breaking bugs then be my guest, this game would be perfect for you. The concept is great but poorly executed. I'm glad I didn't buy the game bundled with Icebourne, it would have been an even bigger waste of money. Yes, I may have 40 hours so you might think ""it can't be that bad"" but I like to get the most out of my money so despite the painfully awful bugs I am determined to finish the game despite it being a total waste of time. Also, may I just add, the devs really need more creativity. 90% of the so called 'monsters' are just dinosaurs with a twist. They aren't original. It would have been nice to see original monsters.  I can safely say that I won't be splashing out and buying Icebourne unless they actually address and fix the massive amount of bugs and other issues. In conclusion, the game is horribly broken and the combat and movement is not by any means fluid and smooth. If you enjoy buggy games then play to your hearts content! If not then don't waste your money. ",0,0

"Amazing. I didn't think I could remember such old times. This game has an excellent combat system, bosses, prescribed characters and its main feature is the plot - I would say all this if it were not for a game with an RPG genre in front of me. A person who liked this game is not interested in the plot in games. His words perfectly explain the high marks in the incentive. Apparently he does not even understand that the shooter is loved primarily for the high-quality shooting in it. Let's get down to business: I'll tell you one story that fans of the new RPGs don't know: One fine day, a new Final Fantasy came out. By special order called ""Final Fantasy Mystic Quest"". But this one was special to Final Fantasy - it was for a Western audience. This JRPG was simplified hundreds of times. It was a game with the worst storyline that no one tried, with a very simplified combat system and faceless characters. Japan frankly considered the West to be blunt. And if you played it, you would get the wrong impression of the genre as a whole. The West rejected her, and she sank into obscurity ... as everyone thought. But some guys who, apparently, grew up on this game, decided to create their own, with great enthusiasm and without a scriptwriter. And it turned out to be Battle Chasers: Nightwar. Just imagine the most clichéd characters, no. Imagine a cliché character. Dialogue example: - May I come with you? - No! - But I can patrol too! - No! Stay here and sleep already! - and only the slam of the door accompanied his words. Karl approaches Masha. - Do not worry. He just cares about you - Karl said confidently. - Well, of course! So I believed - Masha snorted disapprovingly. This is the dialogue of characters from RPG! Do you directly feel their charisma and individuality? Unpredictability in their actions? Do you have any thoughts that one of them is a ""dark horse""? And what a story awaits them! As a reward, by the way, you will receive one of the most open endings that the world has ever seen. Agree, the screenwriter has not reached the bar a bit, but he is almost as good as in Chrono Trigger? How can Final Fantasy ?? Or maybe he made it to the Persona series? Ah, right, this is the writer of the Lunar series! Oh yes, a couple of people have forgotten what these games are, and the other has only heard about them or first meets certain names. Fallout 4 is very popular because it completely cut off the RPG system and do you know why you like this game? Because she did the same thing as everyone's favorite Fallout 4. Mmmm, and the quests straight from the MMO, where they explain to you for two hours what you need to do ... just a fairy tale. So stop joking about the dialogue wheel in Fallout 4? Games come out where this wheel is the center of the genre, but you drool, each time spinning it like Yakubovich starting a drum. P.S in 2017, the game crashes for many after a couple of hours. Is the game worth buying? Of course! If you are part of the audience for which that very special ending was prepared! If yes, then of course - this game will be an excellent acquisition for you even for a full price. Besides the fact that she works less stable than her older brother ... Lastly, I can only say these words with sadness and summarize them: If you really like this game, then I can only pat you on the shoulder sympathetically. Since you missed the genre from which ""tore the tower"" at one time. And now it is quite possible - he was so good. It’s sad when an entire generation will be content with nothing but scraps from the table of such a great genre as JRPG. Until now ""J"" ... Until now, only Japan can do things that the rest of the world cannot copy. ",0,0

"Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a CRPG featuring kingdom management.  The kingdom management is a chore, very little of what you choose to do is reflected in the areas you can visit or even on the overland map. All your villages and towns you build look exactly the same bar three (one of which is your capital.) You assign people to tasks and then cross your fingers. If the die roll goes badly then your kingdom can fall apart very easily and if -5 loyalty sends the populace into panic, +5 loyalty on the next card won't be anywhere close to bringing things back to the level. You're a ruler and you have a military, but you can't make them do anything. Monsters in the woods? The Baron will sort it! Neighbouring kingdom sending raiding parties across the border? Yep, the Baron will sort it! Some random bloke didn't find his way home? Call the Baron! I know this stuff is the meat of most CRPGs but if you give me some degree of power, please at least also give me a chance to use it. It's incredibly frustrating how little any of the kingdom stuff actually matters, but you have to engage with it because if your kingdom fails it's a game over. As for the actual, party-based role playing side of things... Meh. It looks lovely and there is fun to be had but it just seems to drag on and on and nothing is ever really interesting. You start out weak and you level and, well... half the time, it's 4 HP and that's about it. I know this is from the table top rules but 4 HP can feel like a real lifeline when you're playing table top - you know where it all goes, you know how close you were to death that one time, those 4 points can be enough to keep you active just one more round. Here, because it's RTwP rather than turn-based, it feels hard to keep track of anything and nothing really seems interesting. You buff your party, you send them to fight and then... well, things just start happening all over the place. Yes you can slow things down and also set triggers to auto pause but then the pacing is all off, it's no fun and honestly an actual turn based mode giving you time to think about things would work so much better. I'm no stranger to cheesing a RTwP game (I remember pulling Gnolls or Hobgoblins a few at a time through the mine in Baldur's Gate, then just napping for 8 hours whilst all the other baddies just ignored you) and you can do the same here, but you need supplies so it's just another thing to have to consider that doesn't really add anything to the game. Travel on the map is slow and boring and you just have to rest all the bloody time. Random encounters are dull and if it ever says there's someone friendly, well, it's basically one specific NPC who you will encounter over and over again because you keep accepting the encounter just in case it's someone new. The areas themselves are really pretty but maps get reused and a lot of the time there really isn't anything interesting or unique to find. Less areas with more interesting stuff to see, do and interact with would really have gone a long way in my opinion. It also doesn't help that new and potentially very important NPCs or events can spawn in areas you've already visited with no indication that they're there. So even if you've fully cleared that tiny riverbank map, make sure to revisit it time and again because otherwise you may find your fledgling kingdom short staffed for a long while. Overall I just can't recommend the game and I think the achievement percentages speak for themselves in some ways. apparently, only 6.4% of Steam players have actually beaten the game. For now, I won't be one of them. Maybe I'll come back in a few months and finish things off but right now, I just cannot be bothered. ",0,0

"No. Perhaps the plot in this ""game"" is good and emotional, and that's what I love. But the problem is that this is not a game at all, not even a walking simulator, this is some kind of, sorry, draw * ilnya. Why the heck these huge and extremely monotonous spaces if there is no gameplay? It looks interesting from the pictures, yes, it's beautiful even in a sense, BUT - it's from pictures, screenshots. And when you run around these huge and monotonous locations (I got to the 3rd one, I don't know how many there are, it became unbearable further) for a long time, doing nothing but collecting ""stars"" and digging ""holes"", it is very tiring, and the further, the stronger. Yeah, well, there are puzzles that a first grader can solve. There are platforming elements when collecting ""stars"", but because of the absolutely curved animation of the fox and the inconvenience of returning to the jump location, I, for example, in the first location, hunting for one star, spent 10 minutes for one! Perhaps there is still something further (although it is unlikely, I think, I was already at the finish line, when patience ran out, judging by the time played in other reviews (I have less real time than indicated. In positive reviews, they mainly mention deep and emotional plot / story. But really it could not be presented in some way digestible? Even within the framework of ""walking simulators"" it could be done much more elegantly, without such an absolutely unnecessary draw * a. Because with such gameplay the desire to know this story to the end disappears with every minute, there is only a desire to finish off and forget, and less and less you begin to listen / read the remarks. As a result, I was not enough to ""finish off"". Of the pluses: 1. The most important thing is the English voice acting of two ... characters? It's nice to listen to their speech. 2. The music is not bad, but you also quickly stop paying attention, it gets boring. I repeat, the story in this ""game"" is probably good. But the way they want to reveal it from us kills all the desire to do it. want and an interesting story, I will read an interesting novel / story or watch an interesting film. The game should also have more or less interesting gameplay, or at least not annoying. ",0,0
"Before version 1.0 came out, I could safely say that this was my favorite game, but sadly they screwed it up and it hurts, because I had become so fond of it. To begin with, I loved the menu that I had; It was minimalist, with just the right information on the screen and nothing else. After the final version it turned into a fucking maze. The first time I went in, I spent about 10 minutes looking for things that before the update were clear to the naked eye. On the other hand they ruined the sound system. The footsteps are heard at 40 meters, and I always feel that the other person is half the distance that he really is because his footsteps are very loud. They did a rework to the graphics system and the only bad thing that I really see is that it looks very dark. Otherwise it's pretty good, although I never really look at this aspect. Another thing, and it is what bothers me the most, is the microtransaction system. Why? The game was excellent without that, and yet they added it, making it look like just another game on the market. They also put a DLC that has 5 skins and absolutely nothing else. Absolute rubbish. In short, having played over 100 hours of early access, and having been my favorite game, I have to say that they are doing very badly. I hope they return to the path they had when they started because I really don't want to leave it. It still seems like a great game. But I'm not liking at all where they are going ... ",0,0

"A casual turn-based shooter (yes, a shooter). I didn't expect an XCom or JA level game, but I thought there would be at least some TACTICS. The first couple of hours you really think that there is at least some semblance of a strategy and worry about the death of soldiers and the loss of money on the mission, but then it becomes clear that the best and most working tactic in the game is to recruit more grenade launchers and, like artillery, mow 90% of the enemies ... By the middle of the first campaign, you will be able to assemble an uber squad of almost indestructible grenade launchers and special forces with rifles, which will be practically invincible. There will be enough money and pumping points for units for another dozen recruits, and all that remains is to complete the same type of side missions to open access to the main one. But the problem is that you are given the same side effects over and over again - these are literally the same locations, with the same tasks and even the location (!) Of enemies. In a couple of times you will learn them by heart, you will know who is standing where and who will come from where. Opponents shoot painfully, but terribly stupid - they can safely run past units or just stick their face into the wall while you escort the hostage past them. The only difficulty at first will be the protection of the ""head"" of the squad - the sickly Murphy loves to die, which leads to the failure of the mission. But everything changes when you open Carrillo - he is so cool, mobile and powerful that he alone can easily clear locations and complete missions, which turns the game into a turn-based analogue of ""Commando"" with Schwartz. The problem with the game is not that it is linear or that you can walk with only one unit - Narcos: Rise of the Cartels is terribly monotonous, very simple and just plain boring, a typical hack based on the popular TV series. Usually I even try to master every trash to the end, but then I only mastered the campaign for the DEA - I don't want to eat the cactus any further.

Anyway, how should I rate this game with no talk to do except for a dildo? Can the characters be downloaded from the Saintsrow website? If you want to apply a different weapon skin to the type of weapon you want, select the skin you want to change, pick it up, go back to the store and wait for a shot, and then go back to the store and choose a weapon to get the skin covered? What to say Gameplay? Dildo Bamya Bangya Superpowers Lifeless City This is all I can say. Besides, I tried to make it serious somehow, but the damn's predecessor, The Third, keeps running around in my head, so it doesn’t look serious at all. Here is how serious the death of this game reminds us? I pulled out Jinya's hair like a mortal combat, and that's the only thing that remains in the impression. Even that didn't seem serious. Compared to SR2, it is a very uninteresting side activity? Um... I just deleted it. Then, after hearing the sound that the SR3 characters could be put on SR4, I repainted it.. It seems like I have to install the character on the Saintsrow homepage. For reference, I don't know why, but I couldn't sign up for membership. I don't know, anyway, I like the FL1PPY YouTube channel. Subscribe. Try it. There are some videos of the third bugs. Anyway, the gameplay doesn't seem to have been improved.

"""NeverEnd"" is a little indie rogue-like top-down dungeon crawler. A story doesn't need such a game. At its core, it's all about surviving as long as possible. To do this, we go (preferably with controller control) from procedurally generated space to procedurally generated space. Whereby so much variance does not have to be generated procedurally, because all rooms are equally square. There are no less than 3 (in words three) different opponents for normal opponents. Zombies, spiders and anything that might be a rat or a wolf. There are still rooms with water where we drown and rooms where we can buy healing potions or something like a throwing spear. And at some point there will be something like a boss. And that's essentially it. There isn't much more. We are equipped with a sharp stick and a shield and throw ourselves against the clearly arranged and rather slow hordes of opponents. Whereby our shield is pretty much completely useless and there is actually only one tactic against all opponents that enables us not to die: hit it once and run away again. And then you repeat that endlessly. And that with extremely spongy and imprecise controls, which hardly allow you to act really skillfully. The graphics are awkward, blocky Minecraft without charm.

"From the title, I expected an endless stay on the way for some specific purpose, such as finding a daughter and / or wife on the other side of the world or a desire to get to a shelter, a group of survivors, having heard about them on the radio .. In fact, we get the absence of any plot, background and even the ultimate goal - the game does not live up to its name """"; except that the main character has an SUV prepared for the zombie apocalypse. Shooting in the game is disgusting - very poorly done. The AIs are incredibly stupid - they don't even have an animation of shooting, if it's bandits, or animation of an attack in animals. A hot rod of a demi-baggy with two bandits constantly flies out of nowhere over our souls - yes, you can drain the gasoline from their clunker, but their appearance is unreasonable. It's one thing if we attacked one of their points, a gas station, but another thing is when they simply spawn with nothing to do every 3-5 minutes .. The world is not interesting to explore - it is empty. There are few items, there is no need for anything. Moreover, the fact of survival is also spoiled by the presence of a helicopter and traders - seriously, why the hell are traders with trash constantly hanging around in one place, especially in our deserted base, during that apocalypse? There are no other NPCs in the world - there is only a board of simple tasks, the rewards for which were simply not introduced, well, there is a main task leading the player by the handle, worse than training. The visual, albeit stylish, but with the color scheme and lighting, they lost out - they overexposed the game, filling it with hard, solid colors. They took the animations from the trash can - the bandits shoot without even raising their hands, and bears, wolves and other animals walk as if they were training before performing in a circus. As a result, this is another game where there was so much room for imagination, such a good idea, but, in the end, all this turned out to be implemented through the backside or not implemented at all ..

"I haven't seen much of the story yet so I can't judge on that, but even if it's good I won't be able to recommend this game since it's optimization is horrible and it crashes a lot... I don't know what the problem could be since my PC is well above recommended specs and I didn't experience issues like these in other games with similar or even better graphics. Also my USB controller started acting up after a while of playing and I don't understand why, cause again, it's only in this game. I like Human Revolution, but mankind divided is giving me a hard time liking it. ",0,0

"The Forge tomb is fun to play however it takes around 10-15 minutes to solve what you're supposed to do and that's pretty much it. This whole DLC takes maximum 30 minutes to finish, so it does not worth its price unless you buy the Croft Edition or Season Pass separately -I really do hope they bring the Endurance mode instead of these challenge tombs- With this DLC you're going to get:  - The Challenge Tomb (you can play it in coop mode if you want, but that feature is literally a joke. You can solve the tomb on your own ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ There are two paths you can enter the tomb. You can do it solo or you need someone else to just shoot an arrow so you can land on another piece of land that will eventually take you to the same tomb from another angle lol THAT IS THE COOP) - The same freaking tomb you completed in main story, but wait, this time it's different because you can do it from the main menu. Also it has time and score attack challenges, only god knows why. - The Echoes of the Past side quest, which is just another mission that makes Lara only an interloper to the story. There is little to no combat, a little bit of parkouring and omg looong long cinematics of people talking about their grandmas hiding stuff. - Also you get an outfit, the same outfit with a different color if you complete the side quest, a weapon, the same weapon with a different color if you complete the side quest and the Grenadier skill.  Please Square Enix, there are no enemies in the game after you complete the main story, what are we supposed to do with a grenade launcher? ",0,0

"Ok so hear me out here i do not dislike this game by any means but i just cant recommend it in its current state why so may you ask well because of it's performance and graphical glitches but Il jump to the cons and pros here pros : IT IS ABSOLUTELY GIANT it has great settings to temper with and alot of them it is a big and satisfying game and it is also pretty fun cons : IT IS ABSOLUTELY GIANT it has just flat out bad performence on every system  you walk slow. Weapons gear, cars and basicly everything is a little hard to find and you walk really really slow conclusion : it is a good game personal preference mostly but I just cant recommend it running at 30 fps if your lucky on a sli gtx 970,16gb of ram and i5 4460 ",0,1

"I must need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NASA computer to run this like I'm lagging my balls off on a 2 player private server on lowest settings, my computer isn't that bad, I can run other games just as big and good as ARK, it's honestly just terribly optimized right now. Would be fun if it was optimized better, it's a good game. I love ARK, and it's sad I can't play it to it's full potential. This is probably 50% negative and 50% positive, because it's a great game, just terrible optimization. But since it's not 100% my fault that it's hard to run, I'm putting a negative review. This review is bound to change if it gets optimized. ",0,0
"Fu. Homefront is not a competitor, let alone CoD MW3, which was released in the same year, but in general to any even a little self-respecting shooter: just disgusting oak shooting, bullets stuck in textures, animation bugs, total scripting of everything and everyone, weird triangular and very stupid dummies - opponents, a bunch of plot stupidity, spouting patriotism and jailbreak from everywhere, but, what is most interesting, it is in the game, although the page on Steam says the opposite. A pleasant, one might say, surprise. Perhaps the multiplayer was good at the time. I don’t know, I didn’t play. But I know that even in the most creepy CoD in multiplayer, you can assemble a full match, and here exactly 0 people are playing it now, which seems to hint. I decided to clean the backlog, damn it. Thank you though that this disgrace lasts only 4 hours. 1/10. Pure point for screaming Wilhelm. ",0,0

"It's just unbelievable how bad this game is for a F2P part of a title that sells for 60€! I loved PES from 2006-2010, bought all of them, but from then on, PES has just been a disappointment. I don't play FIFA, I don't like the game and its ""robotic style"", so I thought I'd give this year's PES a try, after 21h of playing this game with friends and alone, I can say, without even a little bit of doubt that this game is completely scripted. Some games you win 100% of the important rebounds and others, the other team does. It feels like the game controls itself, and that the hours and effort you put into it are just worthless, since the game decides the winner itself. I love the graphics, the gameplay is smoothish, shots could be improved and goalkeeping animations too, but, like I said before, it's the scripting and the momentum that ruin this game for sure, my friends and I are done raging at it, as it's too bad to be true some times, at this point we can only laugh at it. The only other thing that bothers me, is the amount of time it takes for players to perform actions sometimes, like, you command them, and they only act on it 1 second later, it's like they're stuck in an animation or something and can't perform it right away. Anyways, if the scripting/momentum were to be fixed, aswell as the delay in some actions, I would play this game a LOT, the way it is right now, it's just a game that you come and play for 1h-1h30 max for laughs with your friends. (only because it's free, I'd never pay for the game the way it is right now). ",0,0

"Civilization VI is the perfect example of ""What you can have, and what you have"", a game with polished and fun gameplay, graphics and very good performance, a more decent online than in its previous installment. But all of this is knocked down by how badly programmed the AI ​​is. Damn it can't be that of these 27 hours, in which there are 6 games. In 4 I have had to give up at most 20 minutes because the AI, even if you do everything they want, declare war on you anyway, it is not possible that a game that encourages you to play to your liking, for a Shitty programming forces you to just one way to play. A game that prioritizes the fun of the player (In words) At the moment of playing it seems that they are only responsible for trampling you and frustrating you. It is not possible that I, having only 3 military units in my city TO DEFEND IT, denounce me for Belicoso. And a civilization with 8 or 9 units destroying everything left and right will be applauded from all sides. In short, all this is a shame because this Civilization has very good mechanics unlike the rest, and they make it quite cool. But believe me that with this little big AI problem the game becomes unplayable, especially for people like me who like cultural victories without many or no conquests. To top it off, they sneak you a free Spyware ... Do yourselves a favor and understand Civilization V, it won't have all these new new mechanics but at least they won't be touching your balls every 3 minutes. ",0,0

"- Features - ""Explore the huge, detailed hotel and reveal dark family secrets"" -> Yes! That's true! But there is not really anything to discover, to collect or anything else! You can find a few items beforehand, but you are only allowed to collect them when the game tells you ... Otherwise nothing happens here, nothing at all. Occasionally you can hear some strange noises, but nothing happens to you. In the end you just walk back and forth and get massively annoyed by ""irving"" <. <""Multi-layered thriller that combines elements of mystery and horror"" -> Nothing happens in the game, nothing! I find the story exciting, but that's about it. I had a bit of horror at the beginning, but then I noticed that nothing happened and the horror was gone. -> Although the destinations are described on the map, they are not displayed. When I found food, I should use the microwave. I ran to my place, but the microwave didn't count ... so back to the kitchen. I had the feeling that all the winding corridors wanted to confuse the player, so that more playing time came together. I had missed an achievement and within 15-20 minutes I was on day 6 ... since I had left time and had a break in the middle, I would not have come more than 2-3 hours. The price of 16.99 € is MUCH too expensive! You play it once, or at most twice because of all the successes, that's it. I got it through HumbeBundle. I would buy it for max. 4.99 €. Story is good, I liked the story the first time, but the hotel is basically just optics ... as I said, there is nothing to discover let alone collectibles etc. Since there is no neutral button, I do not recommend the game!

"Early access game ... I don't recommend it. Basically because you never know if you haven't done / found something necessary or if the game is in error because it is in development. ex .. I have an achievement that I didn't unlock and I'm sure I should, searching the forums reported the same thing. Since 2015 in Early Access, a long time. The Game does not warn that it does not have an ending, it does not warn that the ending can be activated in the community and it does not warn that it will erase all its current progress. Adding the fact that it doesn't have save slots, it's just the same for everything. it's gone already. Many bugs, the raft is difficult to build and after 90 hours of play mine disappeared, just disappeared, out of nowhere, with all the items inside it. A mistake admitted by the developer and supposedly ""fixed"" in 2016. I found out by researching this. other things: Tubarão enters the sand on the beach (bizarre), construction mode has basic mistakes and no logic, when the raft runs out of gas you are thrown into the sea among others. kkkkkkkk Game is good yes and very beautiful, really promising, but it is a long time in early access and an item collection game, where the items can disappear, end up taking away the credibility of the game. Even more that we see the developer more concerned with launching the game on other platforms than to fix the existing errors. Hoping someday to be complete. a feather. ",0,1

"Game is over tuned.  If you thought other Idle games took a lot of time, you are in for a surprise.  This takes the entire idle idea and multiplies the time it takes.  The only way I can see any progression being viable is to spend money which completely removes the fact that this game is supposedly Free to Play. At the time of this review, I have thousands of hours of Idle game experience, 29 active hours played in this game, and weeks of offline progress checked at least once daily.  I'm not even close to completing the second mission in the game.  I have checked every resource possible for the most optimal formations using the original heroes given to you. The time investment required to ""complete"" this game as F2P I think may be impossible.  The events that the game runs, which offers new/special heroes are impossible to complete, without an investment.  This is a Beta review, so maybe on full release it will be different, or maybe just logging in tomorrow might be different. Code Name Entertainment has Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms available for free on Steam, and it doesn't have these problems.  There are countless other idle games out there.

"The unpopular opinion. Yes its an extension to the original Portal but the jokes are more forced, the new gameplay mechanics are more confusing, The style of the game has changed to a modular style instead of the old industrial setting like that of Portal. GLADoS is more emotive and more unnatural than before. The new level design looks too cartoony. The community test chambers are MUCH easier to add than before. It's cool to play them. Main story is intresting but doesn't align well with the old story. ",0,0
"Launched the game, pressed the play button in the lobby. The graphics are cool, though the foliage is a little bright. And so nothing - according to the schedule, the developers tried very hard. And the grass is beautiful and shimmers cool - I have not seen this in any game. Many plants, weather, dog, water and sound. The sound of the weapon is good too. The atmosphere was developed êàî coolly muddied (but that's why? Read more) .. And now on the game itself and the gameplay: Sheer fucking. You are born in a world where no one is. You have a sniper rifle in your hands and you move VERY SLOW. Just some kind of kapets, you turn on the run - and the dude starts constantly BREATHING loudly - although he doesn't get tired :) In short, where to go - you don't even shoot a hollow. With a clever look, you open the card, look, you don't fucking understand - and you close it. On it, besides the house where you were born, it is also fucking not clear. Just a map, why - xs ... You go wherever you go. In general, you are pissing somewhere loudly BREATHING from fatigue for 20-30 minutes. And then your radar starts showing an animal next to it, you start to strive, you hear how the animal makes sounds. ""This is it"" - I thought! I aim at the optics - ""and really some kind of deer !!!"" I press shoot - and then HOOK! A pop-up menu pops up and says: ""You don't have a license to kill these animals .."". There are no fucking words. Okay, I crashed in some career. Launching the level again just was born in a different place. Again - where to go xs. I went somewhere. I walked for more than 40 minutes, enjoyed the edge, and then the HOOYAK - a black screen, and the message ""Lost connection to the server ... Reconnect ..."". Closed the game and deleted ... ",0,0
